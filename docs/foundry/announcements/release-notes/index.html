AIP Agent Studio is a powerful application designed for building interactive AI assistants known as AIP Agents, which can be equipped with enterprise-specific information and tools to execute tasks. AIP Agents can be deployed internally on the Palantir platform and externally through theÂ [Ontology SDK](../ontology-sdk/overview.md)Â andÂ [platform APIs](/docs/foundry/api/aip-agents-v2-resources/agents/agent-basics).\n\nAgents built in AIP Agent Studio are powered by large language models, the Ontology, documents, and custom tools. AIP Agents can be integrated into applications to facilitate dynamic, context-aware read and write workflows that enable you to automate tasks and reduce manual application interactions.\n\n![AIP Agent configuration in AIP Agent Studio.](./media/2025-04-22-025346-aip-agent-studio-cleanshot-2025-03-31-at-20-21-23@2x-pn.png)\n\n_AIP Agent configuration in AIP Agent Studio._\n\nKey features of AIP Agent Studio:\n\n* **Enterprise-specific context:** Build agents that use enterprise-specific information, ensuring they deliver relevant and accurate responses tailored to your organization's needs.\n* **Natural language interface:** Interact with your agents using natural language, making it easier to operationalize workflows and automate tasks.\n* **Secure and controlled access:** Built on the rigorous security model of the Palantir platform, AIP Agent Studio ensures that LLMs only have access to necessary information.\n* **Flexible deployment**: Deploy AIP Agents internally on the Palantir platform or externally through the Ontology SDK and platform APIs, providing versatility in usage and integration.\n\nTo get started with AIP Agents and create increasingly complex, automated workflows, we recommend using the agent tier framework.\n\n![The agent tier framework where every tier increases in complexity and automation.](./media/2025-04-22-025351-aip-agent-studio-cleanshot-2025-03-31-at-20-09-10@2x-pn.png)\n\n_The agent tier framework, where every tier increases in complexity and automation._\n\n* **Tier 1: Ad-hoc analysis**: Use AIP Threads for ad-hoc document analysis and productivity improvements. Start by navigating to [AIP Threads](../threads/getting-started.md).\n\n* **Tier 2: Task-specific agent**: Create agents that can use Ontology, document, or custom function-backed context, allowing for more targeted and specific interactions. Start by [upgrading your thread configuration to an AIP Agent](../threads/getting-started.md#upgrade-a-thread-configuration-to-an-aip-agent) or [creating an AIP Agent in AIP Agent Studio](../agent-studio/getting-started).\n* **Tier 3: Agentic application**: Incorporate AIP Agents into Workshop or third-party applications that allow agents to read from and update application state. Start by adding [application state](../agent-studio/application-state.md) to your agent and deploying it in Workshop using the [AIP Interactive Widget](../workshop/widgets-aip-interactive.md).\n* **Tier 4: Automated agent**: Automate and delegate tasks to your agent, enabling agents to handle complex workflows autonomously. Start by publishing your [agent as a function](../agent-studio/agents-as-functions.md) and pulling it into[ automations](../automate/overview.md).\n\n### Tell us what you think\n\nAs we continue to develop AIP Agent Studio, we want to hear about your experiences and welcome your feedback. Share your thoughts with Palantir Support channels or our [Developer Community â](https://community.palantir.com/ ) using the [aip-agent-studio tag ](https://community.palantir.com/tag/aip-agent-studio)[â](https://community.palantir.com/tag/aip-agent-studio).\n\nLearn more about [getting started](../agent-studio/getting-started.md) with AIP Agent Studio and its[](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/logic/overview/) [core concepts](../agent-studio/core-concepts.md).\n\nNote: AIP feature availability is subject to change and may differ between customers.\n\n## Draft platform admin message below [Docs Team Only] \n\n\u003e _Only required for_ ***application***_-level lifecycle announcements (check \"type\" field in metadata).

AIP Agent studio is a platform for building interactive AI assistants known as AIP Agents, and is available for enrollments that have enabled AIP features. AIP Agents can be equipped with enterprise-specific information and tools to execute tasks across a broad range of contexts, and can be deployed internally on the Palantir platform and externally through theÂ [Ontology SDK](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/ontology-sdk/overview/)Â andÂ [platform APIs](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/api/v2/aip-agents-v2-resources/agents/agent-basics/).\n\nFor more information, see theÂ [documentation](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/agent-studio/overview/)Â and the [announcement](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/announcements/).\n\n##### Managing application access\n\nWhen an application becomes generally available (GA), it is enabled for all users by default. Administrators can manage application access (including the option to proactively disable the application for all or a subset of users) in Control Panel. Any access settings configured before the lifecycle change will persist after the application goes GA. For more details on managing application availability, see theÂ [documentation](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/configure-application-access#lifecycle-stage-updates).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nâ\tWHY AM I RECEIVING THIS EMAIL?\nYou are receiving this message because your email address is registered in theÂ [Control Panel settings forÂ Contact information](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/platform-communications/)Â as a recipient for the \"Platform administration\" communication channel.

A few key highlights:\n\n* Track **token and request usage per minute**, given that LLM capacity is managed at the token per minute (TPM) and request per minute (RPM) level.\n* **Drill down to a single model at a time**, as capacity is managed for each model separately.\n* View **both the enrollment usage overview and zoom in to project level usage**, given that LLM capacity has both an enrollment-level limit and a project-level limit for each project, as explained above. \n* View the **rate limits threshold** - the toggle (on the top right) visualizes when project or enrollment limits are hit, by displaying a dashed line. The limits vary by model and by project. Two rate limit lines are displayed: the enrollment/project limit, and the âbatch limitâ which is capped to 80% of the total capacity for the specific project and for the entire enrollment. Read more about prioritizing interactive requests below. \n* **Filter down to a certain time range, two weeks of data, down to the minute**. Users can drill down to a specific time range either by using the date range filter on the left hand sidebar, or by using a drag-and-drop time range filter over the chart itself. When the time range is shorter than 6 hours, the chart will include segmentation to projects (at the enrollment level) or to resources (at the project level).\n* **Usage overview in a table** - below the chart, the table includes the aggregate of tokens and requests per project (or per resource when filtered to a single project). The table is affected by all filters (time range, model, project filter if applied). \n\n[Learn about AIP usage views, how to take action based on them, and explore additional tools for LLM capacity and cost management.](../resource-management/llm-capacity-management.md#view-usage)\n\n### Share your feedback\n\nWe want to hear what you think about these updates.

That is, whether the condition evaluates as **True** or **False**. \n\nRows where the condition is true will be sent to the first output (the `True` output), and rows where the condition is false will be sent to the second output (the `False` output). \n\nThis enables efficient categorization of your data and facilitates further processing tailored to each category. Additionally, this feature enhances the clarity of your pipeline, making it easier to understand at a glance.\n\n### Example use case\n\nImagine you have a dataset of customer orders and wish to categorize them into high-value and low-value orders. By defining the condition `order_value \u003e 1000`, the split transform will direct orders exceeding $1000 to the `True` output, while all other orders will be channeled to the `False` output.\n\n![This notional example splits orders between the true and false output channels depending on whether the order value is over 1000.](./media/2025-04-08-064212-pipeline-builder-screenshot-2025-04-04-at-2-30-59-pm-pn.png)\n\n_This notional example splits orders between the `true` and `false` output channels depending on whether the order value is over `1000`._\n\nThis allows for targeted analysis and processing of high-value orders.\n\n[Learn more about the split transform ](../pipeline-builder/transforms-split.md)and experience streamlined, condition-based data partitioning today.\n\n### Tell us what you think\n\nAs we continue to develop Pipeline Builder, we want to hear about your experiences and welcome your feedback.

Application variables within AIP agents can be used as deterministic outputs from tools and ontology context. The AIP Interactive Widget also offers additional variables that can be used to create new sessions from external widgets and auto send messages using Workshop events.\n\n### Access mode configuration replaced with new application variable update tool\n\nThe configuration for access mode previously allowed you to determine whether the agent could update a variable or if the value was \"read-only.\" Internally, this involved using a tool to update application state, which required the agent to specify the variable UUID for updates. However, this method was potentially unreliable, as the agent sometimes failed to apply updates before returning the final response. To address these issues, we have replaced this access mode with the **Update application variable** tool, featuring enhanced prompting. When creating a variable, you will now need to manually add the variable with this tool to align with the read/write access configuration. \n\nExisting agents do not need to be updated as we have performed a migration in the backend. \n\nThis new tool enhances transparency by clearly revealing the underlying processes and allows users greater flexibility in configuring the system. Additionally, it enables the language model to specify updates by variable name rather than by ID, resulting in improved performance. Consequently, the variable ID is no longer included in the prompt.\n\n![The update application variable option in the Add tool dropdown.](./media/2025-04-01-121623-aip-agent-studio-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_The update application variable option in the_ ***Add tool*** _dropdown._\n\n### Introducing value visibility for variables\n\nThe LLM does not need to know about every variable; for example, a variable you use as input to function RAG, ontology context RAG, etc. may have no purpose in the compiled prompt. Before this update, each variable was automatically included in the prompt (comprising the name, current value, and description). You can now choose to remove the variable's visibility from the compiled system prompt. We recommend only including variable visibility when necessary, as reducing the amount of context provided to the LLM can decrease confusion and improve accuracy.\n\n![New option to hide the variable value from an agent.](./media/2025-04-01-121626-aip-agent-studio-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_New option to hide the variable value from an agent._\n\n### Deterministic updates for variables\n\nThe **Update application variable** tool introduces an additional step in the thought process that is not always necessary. We have observed that users often anticipate variable updates following the ontology context RAG, functions, and the object query tool. To accommodate this, we have introduced the capability to configure a variable as a \"deterministic\" output for each of these scenarios. When using the tool, ensure that the variable type matches the output type of the respective tool or context. \n\nIn most cases, we strongly recommend prioritizing deterministic updates whenever feasible, rather than relying on the **Update application variable** tool. For the **Object query** tool, you can designate an output object set variable for each configured object type. With the **Call function** tool, you can map functions that have either string or object set outputs to a corresponding variable of the same type. Regarding ontology RAG, you can select an output object type variable that will update with the K most relevant objects after each response.\n\n![Select an object set output variable to update with the k most relevant objects after each response.](./media/2025-04-01-121629-aip-agent-studio-screenshot-2025-03-25-at-6-50-08-pm-pn.png)\n\n_Select an object set output variable to update with the k most relevant objects after each response._\n\n### Deterministic input for object query tool\n\nThe **Object query** tool can also be provided with a initial variable rather than having the agent specify the starting object set. This can be done by mapping the input variable for each object type in the tool config. This is useful if you want the object query tool to start from a pre-filtered object set without any additional prompting. \n\n![Where desired provide an initial variable instead of having the agent specify the starting object set.](./media/2025-04-01-121633-aip-agent-studio-screenshot-2025-03-25-at-6-51-56-pm-pn.png)\n\n_Where desired, provide an initial variable instead of having the agent specify the starting object set._\n\n### Ontology context citation object set variable\n\nSelecting an ontology context citation in the agent response will link out to object views in a new tab. To keep users within the same module, we have added a citation variable to the ontology context configuration. When a citation is selected, this variable will update with a static object set containing just the citation object. This is useful for showing a preview of the object in another widget side by side to the interactive widget and more.\n\n![Select a citation variable in the ontology context configuration to update with a static object set containing just the citation object. ](./media/2025-04-01-121636-aip-agent-studio-screenshot-2025-03-25-at-6-47-59-pm-pn.png)\n\n_Select a citation variable in the ontology context configuration to update with a static object set containing just the citation object._ \n\n### AIP Interactive Widget configuration updates\n\nThe AIP Interactive Widget has an updated configuration panel to improve integration within your Workshop module. The new textbox variable refers to the text of the user textbox. As the user enters text, the variable automatically updates to match the value in the textbox. If the variable is changed from outside the AIP Interactive Widget, a new message with the current value of the variable is sent.\n\nAdditionally, to enable connecting the active session to a string Workshop variable, we have introduced an active session identifier variable which is always up-to-date with the current `sessionRid`. If you change this variable from outside the AIP Interactive Widget, either a new session will be automatically created or an existing session will be switched to if the change contains a `sessionRid`.\n\nWe also added an additional Boolean toggle to hide session history by default. If this toggle is true, regardless of the width of the widget, session history will automatically be collapsed when the module loads.\n\n### Share your feedback\n\nWe want to hear what you think about these updates.

You can useÂ MLFlow[](https://mlflow.org/) in Foundry for model training metrics tracking. MLflow provides:\n\n* Out-of-the-box integrations with numerous open source machine learning frameworks.\n* Auto-logging functionality.\n* Callbacks that can be added when training more complex models in libraries, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. \n\n\nTo get started, install MLflow, create an experiment, and register it as the current in progress MLflow run:\n\n\n```\nimport mlflow\n\nexperiment = model_output.create_experiment(\"my-experiment\")\n\nwith experiment.as_mlflow_run():\n    # This example model is a keras model\n    model.fit(\n        x_train,\n        y_train,\n        batch_size=32,\n        epochs=5,\n        validation_split=0.1,\n        callbacks=[mlflow.keras.MlflowCallback()],\n    )\n```\n\nAny logs written to MLflow in theÂ `as_mlflow_run`Â block will be routed to the corresponding experiment, and can be published alongside the model version at the end of the training job.\n\n\n### Image logging\n\nWhen developing a computer vision model, it can be useful to test the model against a fixed set of validation images during the training job. The experiments framework now allows users to log images at runtime. This allows you to visualize how well a computer vision model is converging over time.\n\n\n\n\n![Visualizing the image-0 and image-1 series across three experiments.](./media/2025-03-27-131807-modeling-screenshot-2025-03-13-at-9-19-36-am-pn.png)\n\n_Visualizing the \"image-0\" and \"image-1\" series across three experiments._\n\nImage logging also offers the ability to log user-generated charts as images.

To follow proper agent hygiene, these organizations should use maintenance windows and practice frequent restarts; however, these were previously not captured in a historical record. Therefore, critical actions taken against an agent were difficult to reference when debugging a failing data connection. With agent change history, we solve this issue by providing a historical list of actions related to agent health. This insight into change history is particularly helpful in circumstances where many users have access to an agent, since you can now view the users associated with each agent event.\n\n![In this example several teammates made changes to the agents configuration.

Once in the Ontology, derived series behave like any other time series property but are calculated on the fly, eliminating the need to manage or store derived data or duplicate those calculations across the platform.\n\n\n### Time Series Catalog\n\nThe recently releasedÂ [Time Series Catalog](../time-series/time-series-catalog.md)Â acts as a splash page and home for multiple time series resource types, including derived series. Time Series Catalog allows you to create new time series in a no-code environment and manage derived series in the Ontology.\n\n![The Time Series Catalog. Navigate to the Derived Series tab to view all available derived series.](./media/2025-03-20-130531-time-series-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_The Time Series Catalog. Navigate to the_ ***Derived Series*** _tab to view all available derived series._\n\n\n### Single derived series \n\nWithin with our new Time Series Catalog, you can now configure [single derived series](../time-series/derived-series-overview.md#) in addition to templated derived series. Single derived series allow you to create logic that is not constrained to all inputs coming from one object. Instead, single derived series are not templated and can operate on many objects. You can also choose to enable [automatic Ontology saving](../time-series/derived-series-overview.md#automatic-saving-requirements) for single derived series rather than resorting to manual saving, allowing you to manage your derived series with ease.\n\n### Streamlined creation flow\n\nPreviously, you would have to create derived series from a Quiver analysis. Using Quiver offers the ability to promote the results of some time series analysis into a derived series. However, due to the large amount of available operations, it can be easy to construct logic in Quiver that is not actually supported in derived series. \n\nNow, you can access a new, [streamlined creation flow from the Time Series Catalog](../time-series/derived-series-create.md#create-derived-series). This flow guides you through the entire creation process, starting from the first step of choosing the derived series type you would like to make.Â \n\n![The first step of the derived series creation flow in Time Series Catalog allowing you to choose a derived series type.](./media/2025-03-20-130536-time-series-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_The first step of the derived series creation flow in Time Series Catalog, allowing you to choose a derived series type._\n\nAfter selecting a type, you will be brought to a time series logic editing view. Here, only operations that are supported for derived series are available to use on your time series data.\n\n### Derived series Workshop widget\n\nFinally, we are excited to announce the [Derived Series widget in Workshop](../time-series/derived-series-widget.md). The Derived Series widget offers a user-friendly platform for managing derived series, focusing on constructing the time series logic. With the Derived Series widget, users can view a simplified version of derived series management options rather than the advanced configurations used in theÂ standard creation flow in Time Series Catalog.\n\n![The Derived Series widget in Workshop displaying templated derived series details for the Machine object type.](./media/2025-03-20-130540-time-series-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_The Derived Series widget in Workshop, displaying templated derived series details for the_ `Machine` _object type._\n\n### Share your feedback\n\nWe want to hear what you think about our updates for derived series and Time Series Catalog.

This feature allows you to publish multiple Workshop modules at once, streamlining your workflow and saving time by eliminating the need to update each module individually.\n\n### Get started\n\nWith the bulk publish feature, you can simultaneously publish updates to Workshop modules that do not automatically publish the latest versions. To get started, navigate to Workflow Builder and select the Workshop nodes you want to publish, right click, and select **Publish** from the context menu.\n\nUpon initiating a bulk publish, a dialog will display the status of your Workshop modules with the following tags:\n\n* **Latest published**: Indicates that the Workshop application is set to automatically publish the latest version.\n* **Published**:  Indicates that even though the Workshop application is not configured to automatically update, it currently holds the latest version.\n\n![The Publish Workshop modules dialog in Workflow Builder displaying the Latest published and Published tags.](./media/2025-03-20-050342-workflow-builder-screenshot-2025-03-13-at-8-21-52-pm-pn.png)\n\n_The_ ***Publish Workshop modules*** _dialog in Workflow Builder, displaying the_ ***Latest published*** _and_ ***Published*** _tags._\n\nWorkshop modules not marked with these tags have not published the latest available versions, and will be eligible for selection in the bulk publish dialog. You can then select **Publish entities** to publish the latest versions of your chosen Workshop modules. \n\n### Seamless integration with Function updates\n\nAlong with publishing the latest available version of a Workshop module, you can update the Functions in a module and publish those modules directly from Workflow Builder. After updating Functions, select **Continue to publish** to open the **Publish Workshop modules** dialog, where you can select **Publish entities** to bulk publish your chosen Workshop modules.\n\n![The Upgrade functions in Workshop modules dialog with the option to Continue to publish.](./media/2025-03-20-050347-workflow-builder-download-pn.png)\n\nThe **Upgrade functions in Workshop modules** dialog, with the option to **Continue to publish**.\n\nLeverage the convenience and efficiency of bulk publishing in Workflow Builder to keep your Workshop modules up to date. Identify modules with unpublished versions, publish multiple modules simultaneously, and update Functions as needed; all from a single, centralized location.\n\n[Learn more about bulk publishing Workshop modules in Workflow Builder.](../workflow-builder/understanding-workflows.md#bulk-publish-workshop-applications)","application":{"id":"workflow-builder","title":"Workflow Builder"},"category":{"id":"ontology","title":"Ontology"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"March 20, 2025"},{"id":"f01323b3-254a-40fc-89c2-5187e7f567bd","releaseNotes":[{"id":"c75f4cfc2d1a0d19ff0efb544e03db335668d3ae1c3aea76929ed75e22bb4006","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"In the Table layout of the Inline Action widget in Workshop, you can now toggle whether you want to enable file upload, adding rows, or removing rows in Workshop.

To help guide your choice of model, the Model Selector provides comprehensive information about model performance indicators (such as model class, cost, speed, and availability) and other key metadata. The model selector is now available on all enrollments as of the week of March 3, 2025.\n\n### Model metadata to help you decide a suitable model for your use case\n\nTo enable quick selection of a model that meets your specific criteria and needs, the Model Selector provides data on each model's capabilities, context window, and training data.\n\n\n![The Model Selector shows you model metadata at a glance when you hover over a LLM selection.](./media/2025-03-04-043302-language-model-service-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_The Model Selector shows you model metadata at a glance when you hover over a LLM selection._\n\n### Model relational attributes to help you compare between available models\n\nModel relational attributes are performance indicators designed to help you analyze and compare models in order to identify the best-suited models for your specific use cases.\n\n\n![From within the Model Selector you can view model relational attributes that help you compare between models using class cost speed and availability considerations.](./media/2025-03-04-043306-language-model-service-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_From within the Model Selector, you can view model relational attributes that help you compare between models using class, cost, speed, and availability considerations._\n\nModel class\nEach model class serves distinct purposes, balancing trade-offs between performance, resource consumption, and task complexity. A `Lightweight` model is typically characterized by faster and less intensive computation, making lightweight models ideal for smaller tasks. In contrast, a `Heavyweight` model is designed to handle complex tasks with a higher degree of accuracy and depth, at the cost of being more resource-intensive. A `Reasoning` model is specialized for tasks that require logical inference and decision-making capabilities, excelling in applications that demand understanding and manipulation of complex relationships and abstract concepts. \n\nCost\nThe cost attribute measures the average expense of processing input and generating output tokens. Lower-cost models will have a value of `Low` while more expensive models will have a value of `High`. \n\nSpeed\nThe speed attribute measures the time it takes a model on average to generate output tokens back to the user. Faster models will have a value of `High` while slower models will have a value of `Low`. \n\nAvailability\nThe availability attribute reflects the capacity and readiness of a model to handle requests, directly derived from its enrollment limit sizes. Availability is determined by comparing the maximum tokens per minute (TPM) and requests per minute (RPM) that each model can utilize without running into rate limits. `High` availability signifies that a model can consume large amounts of TPM/RPM, making it suitable for high-demand scenarios, while `Low` availability indicates a more limited capacity. For detailed information on each model's specific enrollment limit sizes, refer to [documentation on LLM capacity management](../resource-management/llm-capacity-management.md).\n\n### Similar models highlighted to provide you more options\n\nBuilding on the model relational attributes, the **Similar models** section aggregates insights and lists models with the most similar attributes, helping you find other model options quickly.\n\n\n![Review the Similar models section to understand what other models are within range of the attributes held by the LLM you are currently considering.](./media/2025-03-04-043311-language-model-service-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_Review the_ ***Similar models*** _section to understand what other models are within range of the attributes held by the LLM you are currently considering._\n\n[Learn more about the models available in the platform](../platform-overview/aip-capabilities.md#supported-llms).\n\n### Let us know what you think\n\nWe want to hear about your experiences with our language model service and welcome your feedback.

The selected Ontology contains a `Media Object` type._ \n\nMedia support in the Ontology SDK and platform APIs is in a beta state and subject to change during development. To enable media support in Typescript SDKs, navigate to **SDK versions** from the left side panel of Developer Console, then select **Settings** in the upper right corner to open the **Package settings** page. From here, toggle on **TypeScript** beta features. Doing so will enable any beta features available for TypeScript packages in Developer Console, including media APIs.\n\n![The Package settings page in Developer Console with TypeScript beta features enabled.](./media/2025-02-20-065411-ontology-sdk-screenshot-2025-02-19-at-18-06-00-pn.png)\n\n_The_ ***Package settings*** _page in Developer Console, with_ ***TypeScript*** _beta features enabled._\n\n### Media calls in TypeScript OSDK\n\nMedia support in the TypeScript OSDK includes calls to read and upload media and use uploaded media in Ontology Actions. Examples of these calls are included below.\n\n**Read media reference properties**\n\nFetch metadata and contents of your media reference property by calling Â `fetchMetadata()`Â  and Â `fetchContents()`Â  on the media reference property:\n\n```\nimport { OsdkMediaObject } from \"@my-media-osdk/sdk\";\nimport { MediaMetadata, MediaReference } from \"@osdk/api\";\nimport { Osdk, Result } from \"@osdk/client\";\n\nconst result = await client(OsdkMediaObject).fetchOne(\"\u003cprimaryKey\u003e\");\n\n// Fetch metadata of a media property\nconst mediaMetadata = await result.mediaReference?.fetchMetadata();\n\n// Fetch contents of a media property\nconst response = await result.mediaReference?.fetchContents();\n\nif (response.ok) {\n    const data = await response.blob();\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**Upload media to the Ontology**\n\nTo upload media to the Ontology, you must first upload it to a media property of an object type using the method shown below. This returns aÂ `[MediaReference`](/docs/foundry/api/v2/ontologies-v2-resources/media-reference-properties)Â object, which can then be passed to an Action that accepts media as parameters:\n\n```\nimport { EXPERIMENTALNOT_SUPPORTED_YETcreateMediaReference } from \"@osdk/api/unstable\";\nimport { Result, isOk } from \"@osdk/client\";\nimport { MediaReference } from \"@osdk/api\";\n\nasync function uploadMedia() {\n    const file = await fetch(\"file.json\");\n    const blob = await file.blob();\n\n    // Upload media to an object type with a media property. This returns a media reference that can be passed to\n    // a media parameter in an Action.\n    return await client(\n        EXPERIMENTALNOT_SUPPORTED_YETcreateMediaReference,\n    ).createMediaReference({\n        data: await response.blob(),\n        fileName: \"myFile\",\n        objectTypeApi: \"MediaObjectTypeApi\",\n        propertyTypeApi: \"MediaPropertyApi\",\n    });\n}\n\nconst mediaReference: MediaReference = await uploadMedia();\nconst actionResult = client(mediaUploadingAction).applyAction({ media_parameter: mediaReference });\n```\n\n**Use uploaded media in Actions**\n\nOnce you have uploaded the media to Palantir, you can use the returnedÂ `MediaReference`Â to pass to an Action:\n\n```\nimport { createMediaObject } from \"@my-media-osdk/sdk\";\nimport { MediaReference } from \"@osdk/api\";\n\nconst mediaReference: MediaReference = uploadMedia();\nconst result = await client(createMediaObject).applyAction(\n    {\n      \"media_reference\": mediaReference, \n      \"path\": \"value\"\n    },\n    {\n      $returnEdits: true,\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### Media calls in platform APIs\n\nView our platform API reference documentation to learn how to [read](/docs/foundry/api/v2/ontologies-v2-resources/media-reference-properties/read-media-content/) and [upload](/docs/foundry/api/v2/ontologies-v2-resources/media-reference-properties/upload-media-content/) media content.\n\n### We want to hear from you\n\nAs we continue to develop media support in our platform, we want to hear about your experiences and welcome your feedback.

This is ideal for situations where the retrieval methods provided out-of-the-box through Ontology context or document context do not satisfy a given use case. For example, if a user wants to run a semantic search over multiple Ontology object types, the user can configure a Function for it even though it is not currently supported in AIP Agent Studio.\n\n![You can now use Function-backed context to perform custom retrieval on each query in AIP Agent Studio.](./media/2025-02-12-234152-aip-agent-studio-image-pn.png)\n\n_You can now use Function-backed context to perform custom retrieval on each query in AIP Agent Studio._\n\n### Write a custom retrieval Function\n\nUsers can write custom retrieval Functions in TypeScript in the Code Repositories application. To do so, navigate to a TypeScript repository and import theÂ `AipAgentsContextRetrieval`Â function interface. Then, write a function that satisfies the interface as shown below. Note that the function must have `messages` as the only required input in order to satisfy the contract.\n\n```\n@AipAgentsContextRetrieval()\npublic exampleRetrievalFunction(messages: MessageList): RetrievedContext {    \n    let combinedText: string[] = [];    \n    messages.forEach((message) =\u003e {        '\n         ...    \n    })    \n    return {        \n        retrievedPrompt: \"...\"    \n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe retrieval Function must output a string, which will be pasted into the LLM system prompt by AIP Agents to answer user queries. After publishing your Function, chooseÂ **Function-backed context**Â in Agent Studio under theÂ **Retrieval context**Â panel to select a Function for retrieval.\n\n![You can select the context and a Function for retrieval in Retrieval context.](./media/2025-02-12-234157-aip-agent-studio-image-pn.png)\n\n_You can select the context and a Function for retrieval in_ ***Retrieval context***_._\n\n### Application variables in retrieval Functions\n\nCustom retrieval Functions can also take in the values ofÂ [application variables](../agent-studio/application-state.md)Â on the agent as input. To configure this, add optional arguments to the Function definition. Currently, only string and object set application variables are supported, so the Function input must be one of these types.\n\n```\n@AipAgentsContextRetrieval()\npublic movieRetrievalFunction(messages: MessageList, movieTitle?: string, movieSet?: ObjectSet\u003cMovie\u003e): RetrievedContext {    \n    ...\n}\n```\n\n_Use the API name for object types. This can be found in Ontology Manager._\n\nYou can then set a mapping between the application variables on the agent, and function inputs that match their respective types.\n\n![To create application variables navigate to the application variables panel in Agent Studio.](./media/2025-02-12-234203-aip-agent-studio-download-pn.png)\n\n_To create application variables, navigate to the application variables panel in Agent Studio._\n\n### Custom citations\n\nIn addition to support for custom retrieval Functions, AIP Agents now support custom citations. This means that if the LLM responds with citations in a specified format, the AIP Agent frontend will display citation bubbles that enable users to easily verify and explore information sources. With Function-backed context, users can take advantage of this by having their Function return a string that prompts the LLM to write citations in this given format.  The supported citation formats are the following:\n\n* **Ontology object citations**Â should be returned in the following format: `\u003ccitation\u003e\u003ckey\u003eri.phonograph2.object-set...\u003c/key\u003e\u003c/citation\u003e` where theÂ `\u003ckey\u003e\u003c/key\u003e`Â tags encapsulate the object RID. Selecting the citation bubble will link to the Object Explorer view for that object.\n\n* **Document (PDF) citations**Â should be returned in the following format: `\u003ccitation\u003e\u003cmediaSetKey\u003eri.mio.main.media-set...\u003c/mediaSetKey\u003e\u003cmediaItemKey\u003eri.mio.main.media-item...\u003c/mediaItemKey\u003e\u003c/citation\u003e`. Selecting the citation bubble will open a dialog that displays the first page of the document.\n\n* **External URL citations**Â should be returned in the following format:Â `\u003ccitation\u003e\u003cname\u003eMy Website\u003c/name\u003e\u003chref\u003ewww.mywebsite.com\u003c/href\u003e\u003c/citation\u003e`. The citation bubble will display the provided name, (for example: `My website`) and selecting it will link to the provided URL (for example: `www.mywebsite.com`).\n\n![In this example the Function accepts a set of document chunks that are represented as Ontology objects. It then conducts a semantic search on these objects and returns the five most relevant ones formatted according to the citation style mentioned above.](./media/2025-02-12-234209-aip-agent-studio-image-pn.png)\n\n_In this example, the Function accepts a set of document chunks that are represented as Ontology objects. It then conducts a semantic search on these objects and returns the five most relevant ones, formatted according to the citation style mentioned above._\n\n### What's next for AIP Agent Studio?\n\nUsers will soon also be able to write retrieval Functions in AIP Logic, which offers a walk-up usable interface for developing no-code LLM-powered functions. To take advantage of this in the meantime, we recommend writing a TypeScript function that satisfies the interface and calls the Logic function under the hood.","application":{"id":"agent-studio","title":"AIP Agent Studio"},"category":{"id":"platform-overview","title":"AIP"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"af19e38e-574e-4633-8696-93a0359e6261","type":"FEATURE","description":"Notepad users can now edit object properties directly in Notepad documents with Ontology Actions, making it easier to keep documents in sync with Ontology changes.

Using a customized TypeScript OSDK Template as a preconfigured starting point, developers can rapidly start building projects with built-in OSDK packages. By leveraging OSDK Templates, you can ensure consistency across TypeScript projects, or incorporate essential tools and best practices from the outset. \n\nUse TypeScript OSDK Templates to streamline the following use cases:\n\n* Running a bootcamp or a workshop in which all developers need to bootstrap their code with a preconfigured OSDK application.\n* Providing an example for users to kickstart their work.\n* Enforcing a set of UI standards for all React projects.\n* Providing a React template that uses a shared set of Ontology resources.  Review the[ note on using Ontology resources](#a-note-on-using-ontology-resources) below.\n\n### Build an OSDK Template\n\nTo create an OSDK Template, first create a TypeScript Developer Console application and select the option to **Bootstrap using VS Code in Foundry** under the **Start developing** section. This will create a repository for your application code, allowing you to develop the application exactly as you intend users to experience it. Be sure to debug and test your application before creating a template.Â \n\nWhen you are satisfied with your application code, create a template using the following steps: \n\n1. Replace variable instances with handlebars like so: `{{SAMPLE_VARIABLE}}`. Sample variables are listed below:\n\n```\n{{FOUNDRY_HOSTNAME}}=\"yourdomain.palantirfoundry.com\" // .env files, .npmrc, foundry.config.json\n{{APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID}}=\"1564cead075af0e23eb1799ac0f6381f\" // .env files\n{{APPLICATION_PACKAGE_NAME}}=\"osdk-sample-app-20\" // package.json and any code file which references the package \n{{APPLICATION_RID}}=\"ri.third-party-applications.main.application.7ebc94b7-bad3-45a9-a063-d7fc0ccd2873\" // foundry.config.json\n{{REPOSITORY_RID}}=\"ri.stemma.main.repository.35d25ea4-973d-4112-a7d3-04c31efa1875\" // .npmrc setting.sh\n```\n\n* Note that your application package should not includeÂ `@`Â or a trailingÂ `/sdk`Â . The version in the `package.json` must be set to `latest` or `0.1.0`.\n\n* You can also add custom handlebars as input parameters when the package is deployed, as shown below:\n\n\n```\n{{AGENT_RID}}=\"ri.aip-agents..agent.f4a3033a-8b8d-4313-a365-3d8d7099fa95\"\n```\n\n2. Commit your changes. The CI check will fail at this point, but this is expected behavior.\n\n3. Navigate to **Marketplace** to create a new product from your repository.\n\n4. Name your product, choose **Repository** under **Add by resource type,** and select the repository you created. The chosen repository will be displayed under **Repositories** in the **Content** section.\n\n![A list of repositories added as dependencies to the template in Marketplace.](./media/2025-02-14-141647-ontology-sdk-pasted_image-pn.png)\n\n_A list of repositories added as dependencies to the template in Marketplace._\n\n5. Select **+ Add Repository** on the top right of the **Repositories** list under **Content** to include Developer Console as a dependency. We recommend **not** including Ontology resources in the package for reasons outlined below in [using Ontology resources](#a-note-on-using-ontology-resources).\n\nYour package is now ready to be distributed on Marketplace.\n\n### A note on using Ontology resources\n\nOSDK applications use API names to link to Ontology resources, so your code will contain API names from the Ontology used by your template.Â \n\nFor example, the API name of the loaded object typesÂ below is `Aircraft`:\n\n```\nconst response: Result\u003cPageResult\u003cOsdk.Instance\u003cAircraft\u003e\u003e\u003e = \nawait client(Aircraft).fetchPageWithErrors({ $pageSize: 30 });\n```\n\nWe do **not** recommend including Ontology resources in your package. Marketplace will attempt to install them during deployment and create duplicate Ontology resources with different API names, which will lead code to break.\n\nTo avoid this, we recommend one of the following options:\n\n* If the template application does not need to use Ontology resources, you can build a [progressive web application](../ontology-sdk-react-applications/development.md#progressive-web-application-pwa) (PWA) template that can work with any Ontology resource. You can also build a React template that adopts customers' design styles for OSDK-backed applications.\n\n* If users need to access a shared Ontology, they will be prompted to input the necessary Ontology resourcesduring template installation, allowing Ontology resources to be referenced in code.\n\n### Distribute packages on Marketplace\n\nUsers can find your packaged template in the relevant Marketplace store. When installing the template from Marketplace, a new repository and a linked Developer Console application will be automatically created for the user. When using this package for bootstrapping, the **Bootstrap** option must be selected during installation. Improvements to user discovery for OSDK Templates are currently in development to facilitate surfacing templates.\n\nWe created OSDK Templates to accelerate the initial phases of development and help you focus on building, rather than on setup tasks. We encourage you to share feedback with Palantir Support channels and on ourÂ [Developer Community âï¸](https://community.palantir.com/)Â using theÂ [](https://community.palantir.com/tag/foundry-branching)[ontology-sdk âï¸ ](https://community.palantir.com/tag/ontology-sdk)tag.\n\nLearn more about [OSDK](../ontology-sdk/overview.md) and [Marketplace](../marketplace/overview.md).","application":{"id":"ontology-sdk","title":"Ontology SDK"},"category":{"id":"dev-toolchain","title":"Developer Toolchain"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"a2a829c6-3b43-4091-894a-702d406662c5","type":"FEATURE","description":"Function-backed Action types triggered in large batches can now be configured to serve all requests in a single batched Function execution, rather than requiring a separate execution for each request.

For more information on any of these features, review the documentation linked inline below: \n\n* [Custom widgets](../workshop/widgets-iframe.md#custom-widget-via-iframe) allow developers to embed third-party, custom-built components into Workshop applications for the first time. These custom widgets can share variable state and trigger events with their parent Workshop application to integrate seamlessly with native Workshop features.\n* [Module interface](../workshop/module-interface.md) enables builders to easily configure the input variables accepted of a given module and acts as the effective API for the module.\n* [URL routing ](../workshop/routing.md)allows builders to serialize variable state and module state into the URL. This enables easier link sharing between users and also helps a module maintain its state on a browser reload.\n* [Loop layout](../workshop/loop-layouts.md) allows builders to create dynamic, reusable views by looping over an object set and displaying an instance of a custom embedded module per object. \n* [Kiosk mode](../workshop/kiosk-mode.md) enables secure, long-lived user sessions in Workshop. For example, allowlisted applications can be run in Kiosk mode for continuous display on a command center screen, or to enable a shared monitor to display an operational dashboard 24/7.\n* [Autosave](../release-notes/2024.md#b9c10518d883efec7638054097301d1c2ebe09f9625710ed5e91497be2f72507) preserves module edits automatically so builders can edit their applications without worrying about unexpectedly losing progress.\n* [Module rebasing](../workshop/branching-rebasing.md) helps builders merge Workshop application updates from main into the local changes they have made within a branch. This feature, alongside branching, unlocks simultaneous collaborative application building in Workshop.\n* [Copy-paste of components and widgets across modules ](../release-notes/2024.md#83fabc41505d05694633ed20ad9cfea4549f014f5638c72057c7a52bcae0a9b6)greatly speeds the application building process by making Workshop configuration more reusable.\n* [Struct variables](../workshop/struct-variables.md) are a new composite variable type that can be returned from functions and used by builders to decrease network calls and boost the performance of their Workshop applications. \n* [New variable re-computation options](../release-notes/2024.md#41b7df54d3273400dacb866a8af5e933d75d955e36e2905e56cca8767a7ddc48) provide builders more control over on when specific variables in their applications should recalculate; for instance, recalculation can occur automatically, when specifically triggered by an event, or only on initial load.\n* The [Calendar widget](../dynamic-scheduling/scheduling-calendar-overview.md) provides a way to visualize date- or timestamp-backed objects (such as work schedules or flight events) within an interactive calendar.\n* [Allowed URLs and protocols](../release-notes/2025.md#17b2a439-2d07-43ef-b0ba-d05ba9580457) let administrators specify a list of external URLs and schemes to which users can safely navigate without triggering the display of an external link warning.\n* [Gaia cross-app interactions ](../workshop/widgets-app-pairing.md)enable pairing a Gaia map to a Workshop application to seamlessly share state and create powerful geospatial workflow.\n* [Vega charts](../workshop/widgets-vega-chart.md) allow builders to create fully customizable and interactive visualizations in Workshop using the open-source [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)[](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)[ â](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)[](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [Vega-Lite â](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) grammars.\n* [Translations](../workshop/translations.md) give builders the ability to localize Workshop applications into multiple languages, either manually or with the help of AIP Assist-powered translations for enabled enrollments.\n* [Right-to-left text](../release-notes/2024.md#11853a4685848003daa273e2b48d4b820455f42bb8d5fa04c7f19ddf40e1cc15) lets builders adjust text directionality in their applications to accommodate multiple language orientations. \n* The [Audio player \u0026 capture widget ](../release-notes/2024.md#7c45aefa589cd0eb363440304cb445d3e4934f9a33e31b807ce5e972fcc86466)enables audio-based workflows and supports the upload and playback of audio files.\n* [Module headers](../workshop/concepts-layouts.md#header) increase the visualization expressiveness possible in Workshop by providing additional customization, coloring, branding and general styling options for application headers.

Before using Foundry Branching, make sure to familiarize yourself with the full scope of [functionalities](../foundry-branching/supported-functionality.md#supported-functionality-1), and[ known limitations](../foundry-branching/supported-functionality.md#unsupported-functionality). \n\nThe following functionalities will be released in the first half of 2025:\n\n* **Code Repositories:** Dataset branching in Code Repositories is Experimental. Support for **TypeScript functions** is in development.\n* **Restricted views:** Restricted views do not currently build on a branch. If your workflow includes restricted views, we recommend only using Foundry Branching for changes downstream of the Ontology. \n* **Edit-only workflows:** Users can run Actions on branches, but currently, it is not possible to load edits from Main  onto a Foundry branch.\n\nAside from Workshop, applications that consume the Ontology cannot yet be modified on a branch. For instance, if your Workshop module contains non-Workshop elements such as Quiver dashboards, these dashboards will load information from the Main branch and will not be modifiable on a branch. \n\n### Your feedback matters\n\nWe are interested in understanding how this application helps you with your workflow and how we can focus our improvement efforts.

To further customize the user experience, builders can now provide a default agent, an LLM-powered assistant that is equipped with enterprise-specific knowledge to answer queries about custom operational topics. AIP Assist Agents use custom content as their search context, and can be configured in [Agent Studio](../agent-studio/overview.md) [Beta].\n\n### Event Configuration \n\nA default AIP Assist Agent can be selected during event configuration, allowing builders to choose the appropriate agent for the given context. Agents can be given access to custom content, such as documentation about the application being used or other operational processes to provide targeted assistance at relevant times. Selecting an agent is optional, and users can also select a dedicated agent in the AIP Assist sidebar. By selecting a default agent, builders can be sure that the correct agent for the task has been chosen without relying on end-users for manual selection. Prompts sent in the event can be static text or dynamic variables, allowing  builders to tailor the user experience as they see fit based on the prompt and the receiving agent. \n\n![_The agent selector in the_ _Workshop event_ _configuration panel._](./media/1737645061511-image-pn.png)\n\n_The agent selector in the_ _Workshop event_ _configuration panel._\n\nAs an example, if a builder expects that users will have trouble with a specific workflow, they can add a button that will trigger the Send to AIP Assist event with a tooltip that explains the button's usage.\n\n\n\n\n![_An example of a button that triggers the Send to AIP Assist event with an explanatory tooltip._](./media/1737645066489-image-pn.png)\n\n_An example of a button that triggers the Send to AIP Assist event with an explanatory tooltip._\n\nWith this feature, builders can ensure that users have access to immediate interactive support in Workshop application workflows.

To get started, first [build an application in Developer Console](../ontology-sdk/create-a-new-osdk.md). \n2. Then, configure [website hosting](../ontology-sdk/deploy-osdk-application-on-foundry.md) for that application. \n3. Choose to use a [VS Code workspace](../ontology-sdk-react-applications/development.md) to take advantage of the developer features available in the Palantir extension for Visual Studio Code. From either environment, you can create branches in your repository, implement code changes with commits, and push updates. \n4. Once you make a change and checks are complete, navigate to Code Repository and create a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch. \n5. From the **Version control** tab at the top of the screen, choose **Pull Requests**. \n6. Select the pull request you would like to preview, then select **Preview** in the lower right corner to open a preview version of your React application.\n\n![_A pull request in Code Repositories with the option to view a preview of the changes._](./media/1737653117621-screenshot-2025-01-23-at-14-44-17-pn.png)\n\n_A pull request in Code Repositories with the option to view a preview of the changes._\n\nYou can also find a PR preview link for every commit on your branch by navigating to the **Commits** tab of the pull request. Note that PR previews are only available within seven days of the creation of the pull request. After seven days, the preview will expire.\n\n### Preview permissions\n\nTo access the PR preview feature for React applications, users must have proper permissions for the application from Developer Console. To manage these permissions, open your application in Developer Console, then navigate to **Sharing** in the left sidebar. \n\nTo make changes, create pull requests for the application code, and share PR preview with other users, you must have eitherOwner or Editor permissions. To share a PR Preview with a user without granting permissions to edit your application code or configurations, add them as a Viewer  under **Share hosted website**.\n\n![_The permissions configuration page in Developer Console with the option to grant users access to view PR previews._](./media/1737653121154-screenshot-2025-01-23-at-15-52-28-pn.png)\n\n_The permissions configuration page in Developer Console, with the option to grant users access to view PR previews._\n\n### What's next?\n\nWe look forward to building a version control interface directly in VS Code workspaces, removing the need to navigate to Code Repositories to generate PRs and obtain preview links.\n\n### We want to hear from you!\n\nAs we continue to work and improve the Palantir developer experience, we encourage you to leave feedback and comments in our[ community forum â](https://community.palantir.com/). \n\n","application":{"id":"ontology-sdk","title":"Ontology SDK"},"category":{"id":"dev-toolchain","title":"Developer Toolchain"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"January 17, 2025"},{"id":"e5e94e65-ec93-4b77-83c3-06a3605687e4","releaseNotes":[{"id":"aa8a455b-4e64-4a0c-bf99-6e9af1c765fc","type":"FEATURE","description":"As of today, you now have new options in the [Resource Management application](/foundry/resource-management/overview/) to give you more granular control over a Project's [resource queue assignments](/foundry/resource-management/resource-queues/#resource-queue-details), now available on all enrollments.

Like Projects, each priority branch is assigned to a vCPU resource queue, and they can also optionally be assigned to a vGPU resource queue.\n\n![Enable priority branch and manage which vCPU and vGPU resource queues the priority branch uses. ](./media/1737038757574-image-pn.png)\n\n_Enable priority branch and manage which vCPU and vGPU resource queues the priority_ _branch uses._ \n\nStarting from today, you can also view a Project's resource queue assignments in the platform filesystem sidebar.
