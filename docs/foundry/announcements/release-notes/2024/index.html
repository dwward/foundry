AIP Agents are interactive assistants built in [Agent Studio](../agent-studio/overview.md) that can be equipped with enterprise-specific information and tools. This feature simplifies integration and enhances the capabilities available to developers, underscoring our commitment to building a robust development ecosystem.\n\n### AIP Agents in third-party applications\n\nAIP Agents can now be deployed to third-party applications using Palantir platform APIs, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate LLM-powered assistants and provide improved support to end-users. These platform APIs enable users to programmatically create, update, and list conversation sessions with AIP Agents, allowing for embedding within custom application contexts. For more information on using platform APIs and a full list of supported capabilities, refer to the [API documentation](/docs/foundry/api/aip-agents-v2-resources/agents/agent-basics/).\n\n### AIP Agents in Ontology SDK applications [Beta]\n\nAIP Agents can be used in Ontology SDK applications through Developer Console support for platform API and SDK resources. To use an AIP Agent in an Ontology SDK application, add the necessary Ontology resources and the project containing your agent to the application's Platform SDK resources.\n\n![The option to add a project for an AIP Agent in the Developer Console Platform SDK tab under Resources.](./media/1734577976646-osdk-platform-sdk-projects-access-agent-pn.png)\n\n_The option to add_ _a project for an AIP Agent in the Developer Console_ ***P**latform SDK*** _tab under_ ***Resources.***\n\nThen, enable **AIP Agents API** operations for your application, which grants permission to read, create, and update AIP Agent interactions.\n\n![The option to enable the AIP Agents API operations in the Client allowed operations table in your Developer Console application.](./media/1734577980368-osdk-platform-sdk-client-operations-agents-pn.png)\n\n_The option to enable the AIP Agents API operations in the Client allowed operations table in your Developer Console application._\n\nLeverage these new platform APIs in Ontology SDK or third-party applications to provide targeted, real-time support with LLM-powered assistants. To get started with AIP Agents in custom applications, refer to the [AIP Agent Studio](../agent-studio/getting-started.md) and [platform API](/docs/foundry/api/aip-agents-v2-resources/agents/agent-basics/) documentation.","application":{"id":"agent-studio","title":"AIP Agent Studio"},"category":{"id":"platform-overview","title":"AIP"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"a616d8ab0c44e965aaf13f33fdf90d8d475b7b0a5c0bdc311e456fe735df7491","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"The **Styles** panel has been relocated to the sidebar panel, featuring a newly introduced dropdown menu for seamless global stylesheet selection.

With time series alerting, you can maintain awareness of critical workflows in your organization, such as learning when machine pressure exceeds a set limit or when production outputs fall below an expected result. \n\nTo get started with time series alerts, you will first identify periods of interest within time series data using the [Time series search](../quiver/cards-index-event-sets.md#time-series-search) card in Quiver. Then, the logic behind the time series search is saved and replicated across objects of the same type using [Automate](../automate/overview.md).

From then on, it will only check for new data. In other words, this product runs incrementally by default. This is different than both [Foundry Rules](../foundry-rules/timeseries-concepts.md) and [FoundryTS](../time-series/foundryts.md), which both check the entire time series for alerts every time they run. For this reason, using Quiver with Automate for time series alerting will be more performant and cheaper than previous solutions.\n\n### What's next for time series alerting?\n\nTime series alerting automations are not a real-time solution. Although search logic can be automated on time series backed by streams, the automations will not run directly on top of the streaming data but rather on top of the [archive dataset](../building-pipelines/streaming-compute-usage.md). This incurs at least 10 minutes of additional latency since archive jobs run every 10 minutes. Our team will be focused on building a real-time alerting solution in the coming months.\n\n[Learn more about time series alerting automations in our documentation.](../time-series/alerting-overview.md)\n\n","application":{"id":"time-series","title":"Time Series"},"category":{"id":"data-integration","title":"Data Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"December 10, 2024"},{"id":"c2bbaeaa-2a0f-47f2-93c7-57e628c013d2","releaseNotes":[{"id":"cba1698384e69d7ad7b071e597ec12efd5fa3778d3c2f7d75330913ff9de1a55","type":"FIX","description":"This update resolves an edge case with the auto-save feature where the `New version available` banner could incorrectly display.\n","categoryTitle":"App Building","categoryId":"app-building","applicationId":"workshop","applicationTitle":"Workshop","date":"December 6, 2024","title":"Improvements to Workshop auto-save ","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"workshop-app","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"workshop","title":"Workshop"},"category":{"id":"app-building","title":"App Building"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"December 6, 2024"},{"id":"55923742-85d7-4a8c-a30c-247d22336ad3","releaseNotes":[{"id":"495467d8-d192-446a-ba03-2f578a5f0768","type":"FEATURE","description":"Starting today, if you have both the Azure OpenAI and Direct OpenAI model families enabled, your enrollment will haveÂ 2xÂ the amount of TPM (tokens per minute) and RPM (requests per minute) capacity for GPT4o and GPT4o-Mini.

Images contained in media sets, much like tabular text-based data, often require strict protection of their potentially sensitive content through granular data governance. Visual obfuscation's reversibility provides an additional level of data minimization and permission management for an image's sensitive content, as a user with the necessary access granted through a [Cipher decryption license](../cipher/getting-started.md#operational-user-license) can recover an image's obfuscated sections. Users can share an image across different access groups for analysis as a singular data asset - users in one group may be able to view the image's original content, while users in another will only be able to view the image with sensitive regions obfuscated by default. \n\n**Apply visual obfuscation to improve image security and access**\n\nAdministrators can configure a visual obfuscation decryption license to impose limits on decryption frequency. An administrator may also require users to [submit a checkpoint](../checkpoints/configure-checkpoints.md) as justification for viewing sensitive imagery, which collects records of image interactions.\n\nAs an example, a user trained to tag the damaged areas of a car can complete their workflow by viewing an image of the car with its sensitive regions obfuscated, such as the license plate and windows showing the interior. Another user trained to provide customer support can access the same image and decrypt the license plate region to confirm that the vehicle belongs to a specific customer. Additionally, an administrator can verify that the customer support user's interactions adhere to the decryption license's prescribed data governance policy.\n\n![Users can apply the visual obfuscation algorithm to obscure potentially sensitive regions of an image.

You should use PNG files, as other image file types may not support pixel scrambling during encryption and decryption.\n\nYou can use visual obfuscation to:\n\n* Redact image sections containing PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or PHI (Protected Health Information) before providing an image to an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or text extraction model.\n* Reduce an image's sensitivity level by selectively obfuscating certain sections in order to broaden user access to support analysis.\n* Hide parts of images that may introduce bias into a workflow and require a justification to reveal the obfuscated section.\n* Add an additional layer of protection against possible data leaks or permission misconfigurations. \n* [Beta] Interact with obfuscated imagery using the [Image Display widget in Workshop](../cipher/visual-obfuscation.md#steps-to-reproduce), as seen below.\n\n![Window areas which have been visually obfuscated are selected and decrypted using the beta Image Display widget in Workshop.](./media/1732165100926-decrypt_selected_areas_image_display_widget-gi.gif)\n\n_Window areas which have been visually obfuscated are selected and decrypted using the beta Image Display widget in Workshop._\n\nContact your Palantir representative to install visual obfuscation on your Foundry enrollment if it is not currently available.\n\nFor more information, review Cipher's [visual obfuscation documentation](../cipher/visual-obfuscation.md).","application":{"id":"cipher","title":"Cipher"},"category":{"id":"security","title":"Security"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"bb6a1401-eb29-4236-9722-793e59f81660","type":"FEATURE","description":"We are excited to introduce Portfolios, a new way to organize Projects.

There are two ways to do this: If your input data was created from a Data Connection sync, you can add the source to the Pipeline Builder graph by selecting the input data node and using the **Add source to graph** option. \n\n![The Add source to graph option makes it easy to import any Data Connection source.](./media/1731977166330-screenshot-2024-11-13-at-6-25-47-pm-pn.png)\n\n_The_ ***Add source to graph option*** _makes it easy to import any Data Connection source._\n\nAlternatively, you can use theÂ **Add data**Â toolbar button or theÂ **Import data to Foundry**Â action to search for, import, or create sources. SelectÂ **Import data to Foundry**, then choose a new source type to create or search for an existing source to connect.\n\n![Choose from a selection of options to bring your data into Foundry.](./media/1731977170509-screenshot-2024-11-13-at-6-25-34-pm-pn.png)\n\n_Choose from a selection of options to bring your data into Foundry._\n\nOverall, this enhances the ease of integrating various data sources. This ensures that you can quickly connect to and utilize your data without long configuration processes, making your data operations more efficient and reducing setup time.\n\n### Directly input source configuration\n\nOnce the source is imported, you can configure it directly in Pipeline Builder. Under theÂ **Configure** **source** section, you can specify required source-specific configurations. Pipeline Builder supports Foundry-supported JDBC sources that require only mandatory fields. \n\n![Use the Configure source section to input source-specific configurations.](./media/1731977174380-screenshot-2024-11-13-at-6-26-36-pm-pn.png)\n\n_Use the Configure source section to input source-specific configurations._\n\nThis streamlines source creation by centralizing all necessary configurations with the data pipeline logic, ensuring optimal data flow.\n\n### Greater focus with integrated sync creation \n\nThe ability to explore sources and create syncs for batch datasets directly in Pipeline Builder significantly enhances your data management capabilities. This feature allows you to easily identify and sync the data you need, improving data accessibility and ensuring that your datasets are up-to-date.

Plus, bring your own logic without needing to rewrite it in a Foundry-supported language while augmenting Foundryâs capabilities. \n\nThe Compute Modules application is now available in a beta state and available by default in your enrollment.\n\n\n![The Compute Modules application on the Configure page.](./media/1731388237582-screenshot-2024-11-12-at-01-10-18-pn.png)\n\n_The Compute Modules application on the_ ***Configure*** _page._\n\n### Key features\n\nCompute modules are built to cater directly to backend developers, offering a variety of significant features to make the best use of Foundry capabilities while using your own logic and preferred language:\n\n* **Custom APIs and** **functions:** Set up your own APIs and functions to be used seamlessly within [Workshop](../workshop/overview.md), [Slate](../slate/overview.md), [Ontology SDK](../ontology-sdk/overview.md) applications, and other Foundry environments.\n* **Dynamic and** **predictive** **horizontal** **scaling:** If you expect to serve a varying number of requests, compute modules can ensure higher availability by scaling the number of available replicas up or down based on current and historic load.\n* **Internal** **connections:** Create complex Foundry orchestrations across products, including Contour, Ontology resources, and Webhooks, using Foundry API endpoints.\n* **External connections**: Write custom logic leveraging Foundry products. Read and write data or media sets, connect to external systems, and more.\n* **Upgrade** **without downtime:** Update a compute module without any downtime.\n* **Marketplace compatible:** Compute modules can be published to Marketplace so others can leverage your work.\n\n### Practical applications\n\nOnce you get started with a compute module, use it to expand the potential of your critical workflows:\n\n* **Real-time** **data** **streaming:** Connect to arbitrary data sources and ingest data into streams, datasets, or media sets in real time.\n* **Rapid code integration:** Bring in business-critical code in _any_ language with no translation needed. Use this code to back pipelines, Workshop modules, AIP Logic functions, or custom Ontology SDK applications.\n* **Model** **deployment:** Host custom or open-source models from platforms like [Hugging Face â; ](https://huggingface.co/)call them in a pipeline or as a function.\n* **Third-party integration in an afternoon:** Pull in essential proprietary logic from other companies and offer them the opportunity to sell their products in [Marketplace](../marketplace/overview.md). \n\n\nFor more information on getting started with compute modules, [review our public documentation ](../compute-modules/get-started.md)or navigate to the platform documentation in the Compute Modules application.\n\n\n","application":{"id":"","title":"Compute Modules"},"category":{"id":"dev-toolchain","title":"Developer Toolchain"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"November 11, 2024"},{"id":"10b391e5-77af-4258-a73b-0db1cb35837a","releaseNotes":[{"id":"e0e0662c-4d52-461e-9c65-902ddaf42900","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"By default, while using an [Action Tool](/foundry/agent-studio/tools/#types-of-tools), Agents may propose that an action should be executed with specific inputs.

Along with existing generally available features, APIs, and SDKs, we have released new beta functionality and will continue to expand our suite of developer tools in the coming weeks and months as part of our commitment to a development ecosystem tailored to your business and operational needs.\n\n### Ontology APIs and SDKs\n\nThe Palantir platform's foundation as a development ecosystem is [the Ontology](../ontology/overview.md). With the Ontology, you donât need to maintain a mental model of tables or data sources; instead, you can think in terms of the real-world objects and concepts that are essential to your operations. This enables a development ecosystem where the objects and methods are your businessâs operations and you can read and write to the Ontology with minimal code.\n\nTo leverage the Ontology's robust ability to perform high-scale queries and granular governance controls, we offer Ontology [APIs](../api/ontologies-v2-resources/ontologies/ontology-basics.md) and [SDKs](../ontology-sdk/overview.md) that put your organizationâs concepts front and center. If you need to manage landing slots at airports, for example, add an Airport object and a landingSlots link to your Ontology, and our SDKs will generate types and functions based on your specific Ontology that can be used in your applications across the platform.\n\n### New Palantir platform APIs and SDKs\n\nWe have heard substantial feedback from users whose work relies on the Palantir platform, and we are investing heavily in developer tooling to support these users and create new ways to build with the Palantir platform. To facilitate these user workflows, we now offer APIs that enable programmatic management of platform access and the data backing your Ontology, along with existing Ontology APIs. \n\nThese APIs include:\n\n* [Datasets](../api/datasets-v2-resources/datasets/get-dataset.md)\n* [Users](../api/admin-v2-resources/users/get-user.md)\n* [Groups](../api/admin-v2-resources/groups/get-group.md) \n* [Builds](../api/orchestration-v2-resources/builds/get-build.md) [Beta]\n* [Schedules](../api/orchestration-v2-resources/schedules/get-schedule.md) [Beta]\n\nBeta platform SDKs are also available for [Python âï¸](https://github.com/palantir/foundry-platform-python) and [Typescript âï¸](https://github.com/palantir/foundry-platform-typescript). These are usable alongside Ontology SDKs with the same Palantir platform clients, but require a Developer Console application that is not bound to an Ontology. Documentation for these beta SDKs is forthcoming; for now, early adopters can use the READMEs in each repository to get started. \n\n### On-demand developer support from AIP Assist\n\n[AIP Assist](../assist/overview.md) is equipped with Developer Assist, a mode designed to provide immediate, tailored assistance to support development initiatives. Starting the week of November 11th, Developer Assist will provide in-depth explanations and examples directly from platform API reference documentation to help developers make the most of our features and APIs. Developer Assist includes AIP Assist's features for accelerating your workflow, including multi-language support, a user-friendly interface, and iterative improvements powered by user feedback.\n\n### Modular developer tools\n\nIn addition to APIs and SDKs, we offer modular developer tools that will provide you with everything you need to build powerful applications that leverage the Ontology and other Palantir platform features:\n\n* [Developer Console: ](../ontology-sdk/create-a-new-osdk.md)Helps users develop applications that leverage the Palantir platform using our SDKs and OAuth clients.[](../ontology-sdk/create-a-new-osdk.md)\n* [Web hosting](../ontology-sdk/deploy-osdk-application-on-foundry.md)**:** Allows developers to host frontend-only applications built with our SDKs on the Palantir platform, removing the need for an additional hosting infrastructure.\n* [Application-specific documentation](../ontology-sdk/navigation.md#api-documentation)**:** Each Ontology SDK application comes with custom API documentation tailored to the SDK content.\n* [Hosted Git repositories](../code-repositories/overview.md)**:** The Code Repositories application provides a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and collaborating on production-ready code with a user-friendly way to interact with the underlying Git repository.\n* [Hosted Visual Studio Code](../vs-code/overview.md)**:** VS Code Workspaces provides an IDE for writing and collaborating on production-ready code in the Palantir platform.\n\nThe modular nature of these developer tools allows users to use what they need and combine it with existing tools and workflows, providing flexibility and promoting seamless integration.\n\n### Development roadmap\n\nIn the coming months, we are committed to expanding these APIs and SDKs, as well as the tooling surrounding them. Some features coming up in our development roadmap include:\n\n* Developer Console support for managing granular OAuth2 scopes for Platform APIs and Ontology resources.\n* An [AIP Agents](../agent-studio/overview.md) API that will allow users to programmatically build and deploy interactive assistants.\n* A Connectivity API to create connections to external systems and set up data imports and exports.\n* A Streams API for low-latency use cases, to create streaming datasets and publish records to streams.\n\nTo get started with development on the Palantir platform, refer to the [Ontology SDK ](../ontology-sdk/overview.md)and [platform API reference](../api/general/overview/introduction.md) documentation.\n\nAPI and feature availability is subject to change and may differ between customers.","application":{"id":"","title":"Palantir API"},"category":{"id":"ontology","title":"Ontology"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"ca09cabaca4a7e9a52a51481e64421a28018ef6b6858908927779c525e863d0e","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"A new `Groups requested to` filter is now available underneath the **Additional filters** section when the **Access requests** task type is chosen.

This builds on the ability to register custom content sources with AIP Assist, which allows users to add Notepad documents or Rosetta custom documentation to AIP Assist's knowledge base.\n\n### Custom source-backed AIP Agents\n\nIt is important to note how this feature differs from existing AIP Assist support for custom content sources. Serving custom sources with AIP Assist makes content available as a resource when AIP Assist answers user queries, along with Palantir platform and developer documentation. Below you can see the different AIP Assist modes. Without AIP Agents, custom sources can be configured to be available to AIP Assist's default mode.\n\nThe AIP Assist mode selector. \n\nIn contrast, AIP Agents must first be selected from the AIP Assist mode selector, as shown below, and only use the provided custom sources to respond to user questions. As a result, AIP Agents are hyper-focused and purpose-built, providing users with higher quality responses based solely on specialized content sources. This is a powerful new functionality for support teams, developer teams, and platform administrators.\n\nThe AIP Assist mode selector, showing a sample inventory management AIP Agent. \n\n### Create custom LLM-powered assistants in just a few clicks\n\nTo get started with AIP Agents, you must first register custom content sources from Notepad or Rosetta custom documentation. After doing so, you can create an **AIP Assist Agent** in the Agent Studio application and give it access to your custom content sources.\n\nAIP Agent creation in the Agent Studio application.\n\nOnce you have created an AIP Agent and provided it with access to your Notepad content, you are ready to start interacting with it in AIP Assist. Creating specialized LLM-powered assistants is now a streamlined no-code process that you can leverage to fit your operational needs and increase application support for your users.\n\nNote that these features are part of Palantir's AIP offering, and require your enrollment to have [AIP enabled in Control Panel](../administration/enable-aip-features.md). AIP Agents and Agent Studio may not currently be available on all enrollments, contact your Palantir representative to find out if your enrollment is eligible.\n\nLearn more about [AIP Assist custom sources](../assist/aip-assist-custom-docs-overview.md) and [AIP Agents](../assist/agents-in-aip-assist.md).","application":{"id":"","title":"AIP Assist"},"category":{"id":"platform-overview","title":"AIP"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"83fabc41505d05694633ed20ad9cfea4549f014f5638c72057c7a52bcae0a9b6","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"We added the ability to copy and paste components across different modules.

Now, you can conveniently save to the Ontology automatically using the **Save derived series** setting found in the **Derived Series Options** section of any [supported time series card](../time-series/derived-time-series-common-questions.md#which-quiver-cards-are-supported-in-time-series-logic) in Quiver.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 5.39.43â¯PM.png](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.8ff2ca63-dd65-4072-b7fa-24ab6e92b134)\n![Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 5.19.59â¯PM.png](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.5594eeef-8ada-47ad-b72b-e31bbb0bd029)\n\n*The Save derived series option in a Quiver card, and the setting to save automatically to the Ontology in configuration options.*\n\nWe also updated the derived series management experience with a feature-rich time series logic editor, shown below:\n\n![derived-series-logic-tab-2.png](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.10e05d9a-bd4b-4e19-ba17-fe56ab90a185)\n\n*The updated time series logic editor for a Delta pressure derived series.*\n\nFinally, we now provide tooling for managing the derived series that have been saved into the Ontology:\n\n![derived-series-ontology-tab-2.png](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.4a9fc913-b407-4a16-9882-b58c7c794d2b)\n\n*The new Ontology tab for configuring automatic Ontology saving to sensor object types.*\n\n### Why use derived series?\n\nBefore derived series, there was a lack of user-friendly tooling for creating and managing derived series in the platform. Additionally, there was no intuitive way to use transformed time series series across different Palantir applications without materializing the transformed data and manually adding the new series to the Ontology.\n\nNow, users can derive new series in Quiver and save them to the Ontology for use in operational and analytical applications throughout Foundry. Users can also manage the logic and Ontology saving of derived series in a dedicated tool, with calculations only performed when a user requests the derived series.\n\n### Example use case\n\nA current use case for derived series focuses on process optimization for waste water treatment plants, using data science to optimize energy and chemical consumption. With derived series as features to machine learning models, we can streamline the deployment of these models that use live-streamed time series data to inform operational safe water plant decisions at scale.\n\n### What's next for derived series?\n\nOver the upcoming weeks, we will be adding the ability to select a filtered object scope for the root object to which the derived series will be linked.\n\nLearn more about derived series in our documentation, including [permissions requirements](../time-series/derived-series-permissions.md) and how to set up [automatic Ontology saving](../time-series/setup-derived-series.md).","application":{"id":"time-series","title":"Time Series"},"category":{"id":"data-integration","title":"Data Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"ab47ec57-755f-4b3b-8031-770091e47457","type":"FEATURE","description":"We are excited to announce that Object Storage V2 now supports tracking user edit history.

Whether dealing with procurement documents, environmental impact assessments, insurance claims, or shift handover logs, AIP Agents can provide context-aware responses and insights.\n- **Ontology context filtering:** Useful for tasks requiring additional filtering based on the application context. For example, in drafting or brainstorming scenarios, agents can be used to adhere to specific style guidelines published by different stakeholders. This allows for consistent and personalized document generation, such as creating briefings tailored to specific higher-ups' preferences.\n- **Custom documentation assistance:** By [integrating with AIP Assist](./2024-09.md#create-custom-llm-powered-assistants-with-aip-assist-agents-beta), AIP Agents can specialize in responding to queries based solely on custom content sources, making them invaluable for support teams, developer teams, and platform administrators. This functionality extends the power of AIP Agents to custom documentation.\n- **Routine prompting and templating:** Perfect for scenarios requiring routine drafting or templating, such as coding assistance or generating domain-specific language (DSL) rules. Pre-prompting the agent with specific guidelines or templates can significantly enhance performance and consistency.\n\nAIP Agent Studio is not suitable for tasks that require repetitive, well-defined processes. For such use cases, other tools like AIP Logic or AIP Automate may be more appropriate.\n\n**Whatâs next on the development roadmap?**\n\nWe are actively developing AIP Agent Studio and will soon introduce support for deploying AIP Agents externally via the Ontology SDK (OSDK).

This change includes UI updates, improvements to scalability, visibility features for recommendations, and a fix assistant to help users act on recommendations. Linter generates opinionated, actionable recommendations when workflow designs incur unnecessary costs, do not use the latest Palantir platform features, or do not adhere to best practices. You can use these recommendations to reduce costs, optimize your Ontology, and increase pipeline stability and resilience across your enrollment.\n\nWith Linter, you can better understand the wide range of capabilities that the Palantir platform has to offer while monitoring platform updates that could benefit your use case objectives. Linter is enabled by default; if you are a platform administrator you can [configure user group access to Linter](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/configure-application-access/) by navigating to **Control Panel \u003e Application access** for the correct Organization, and selecting the **Manage** option next to Linter.\n\n[Learn more about Linter](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/linter/overview/).\n\n---\n\n### Why was Linter created?\n\nThe Palantir platform is the best place to host workflows, and while application builders aim to design optimized workflows, the reality is that design decisions can prove to be suboptimal in practice. To address this issue, we created Linter to ensure that workflows use available technology and achieve the same results with more efficient use of resources and features.\n\n### When should Linter be used?\n\nLinter can be used at any time, whether you are just getting started with the Palantir platform, or you already have complex and extensive workflows in place. Linter will monitor new and existing workflows and provide ongoing recommendations, performing regularly-occurring sweeps to gather an analysis of the state of your enrollment. These sweeps identify a list of resources that match predefined [rules](../linter/rules.md) and produce a list of [recommendations](../linter/recommendations.md) based on sweep results.\n\n![Linter's Impact Tracking UI displaying the number of actioned recommendations.](image.png)\n\nBecause Palantir platform capabilities are frequently updated, the results of a Linter sweep are dynamic and can change from day to day. To keep up with these changes you can set up a [sweep schedule](../linter/sweep-schedules.md) to periodically perform sweeps against Foundry resources in Projects that belong to a [space](../security/orgs-and-spaces.md#spaces).\n\n![A sample sweep schedule, the option to generate a new schedule, the **Actions** dropdown, and recent sweep statuses.](image.png)\n\n### Reduce costs and optimize workflows\n\nUsers of Linter in beta investigated and eliminated significant amounts of compute-hours of waste in cloud costs, resulting in quantitative improvements. Impact for customers correlates to their platform usage, but even enrollments with relatively small developer bases have benefited from Linter to meet their cloud cost targets.\n\n![Linter's Impact Tracking UI displaying the number of actioned recommendations.](image.png)\n\nSome customers organized sprints to investigate and act on Linter recommendations, while others spread their focus over longer periods by positioning Linter as a supportive tool for resource usage. Many customers now dedicate time to acting on Linter recommendations as a core part of their Palantir platform engagements.\n\nAside from cost reductions, Linter has also been used to recommend workflow updates to make use of newly available features in the Palantir platform. These include opportunities to use [lightweight transforms](../transforms-python/lightweight-api.md) and [native Spark acceleration](/transforms-python/velox-overview.md), neither of which existed at the beginning of this year.\n\nSince Linter's beta release, [the following features have been added, in addition to scalability improvements](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/announcements/2023-08/#introducing-linter-available-mid-september-2023-beta):\n\n- Expansion of Linter [rules](../linter/rules.md), such as the addition of the [dataset can build with lightweight](../linter/rules.md#dataset-can-build-with-lightweight) rule.\n- Introduction of the fix assistant to streamline [fix generation](../linter/fix-assistant.md) and implementation of actions for recommendations.\n- User Interfaces for [impact tracking](../linter/impact-tracking.md) and editing [sweep schedules](../linter/sweep-schedules.md).\n\n[Learn more about Linter](../linter/overview.md).\n\n---\n\nDraft Foghorn Here [Docs Team Only]\n\nOnly required for *application*-level announcements (check \"type\" field in metadata).\n\nFoundry [product lifecycle](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/development-life-cycle/) announcement*\n\nTitle: Linter will be generally available the week of October 7th [GA]\n\nLinter will be generally available for all enrollments the week of October 7th. This change includes UI updates, improvements to scalability, visibility features for actioned recommendations, and a fix assistant to help users act on recommendations. Linter generates opinionated, actionable recommendations when workflow designs incur unnecessary costs, do not use the latest Palantir platform features, or do not adhere to best practices. You can use these recommendations to reduce costs, optimize your Ontology, and increase pipeline stability and resilience across your enrollment.\n\nWith Linter, you can better understand the wide range of capabilities that the Palantir platform has to offer while monitoring platform updates that could benefit your use case objectives.

We recommend that resources always be kept on the latest supported Python version.\n\n### Why is Python 3.8 being deprecated?\n\nOpen source Python marks old Python versions asÂ [End-of-Life (EOL) every year](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)Â and drops official support. Python 3.8 is approaching its EOL and continued use of EOL Python versions exposes security risks. Additionally, open source libraries continue to create new releases which are no longer compatible with these deprecated Python releases, potentially causing failing checks and jobs for unmigrated workflows.\n\n### What does deprecation mean for me as a user?\n\nIf you own resources using a deprecated Python version, note the following important dates:\n\n- **January 31, 2025**: Workflows depending on deprecated Python versions will not be supported anymore and you will receive no support in case of failures. A limited set of resources can be allowlisted for extended support if agreed with Palantir in advance.\n- **April 1, 2025**: All workflows relying on Python 3.8 or older will not be supported anymore and will start failing.\n\n[Foundry resource migration to supported Python versions](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/announcements/2023-07/#foundry-resource-migration-to-supported-python-versions)\n\nFoundry resource migration will follow the patterns below:\n\n- Code repositories: An automatic upgrade will be attempted in the form of an automatic patch pull request. This will be attempted for all resources on Python 3.8, regardless of priority.Â \n- Other resources: Informational banners containing migration instructions from the deprecated Python versions will be displayed. Review theÂ [troubleshooting guide](../transforms-python/environment-troubleshooting.md)Â for more information.\n\nCurrently, the latest version of Python supported in platform is Python 3.11.Â \n\n### Future Python version deprecation\n\nStarting from Python 3.9, the Palantir platform will closely follow the upstream end-of-life timelines and will deprecate Python versions in-platform as soon as they reach upstream end-of-life.

From your model overview page, you can now deploy models with [one click](2d340e8a-0c4f-4ce7-855d-698378fe875b) on either the **Start deployment** or **Start \u0026 run** option, without going through the [Modeling Objectives](../model-integration/objectives.md) application flow. Additionally, we are introducing multiple improvements to our infrastructure that enable faster startup times, cleaner functions Integration, autoscaling through [Compute Modules](https://www.palantir../compute-modules/overview.md), auto-upgrades, inference type safety, and more.\n\nUsers can now deploy a model directly from the model's Overview page.\n\nSimplify auto-upgrades and autoscale down to zero for cost savings\n\nModel deployment can now be fully managed from the model's overview page. You can start, stop, update model scaling configuration, and also test inference in the same interface. As deployments are now backed by Compute Modules, you can benefit from its autoscaling capacity which spins up or draws down replicas dynamically in relation to the model's inference traffic and usage.\n\nFor example, if your request load only comes at specific times, you can now set the range of replicas to be made available and scalable to actual request volumes. You can even scale replicas down to a minimum of zero to benefit from potential cost-savings if your model deployment is periodically not queried.\n\nConfiguring runtime scaling and resource availability based on model deployment needs.\n\nModel deployments follow a user's branch of the model, making updates seamless. Simply publish a new model version from either Code Repositories or Code Workspaces, and the existing model deployment will be upgraded, ensuring all downstream workflows are always pointing to the latest model.\n\nFunctions integration without the need for a TypeScript repository\n\nA model deployment can now easily be registered as a function and used directly within [Workshop](../workshop/overview.md), saving you the time and effort from building and using a TypeScript repository. Additionally, benefit from support for tabular inputs and outputs, with more types of models now supported as functions in the Modeling Objectives application. Specifically, models with Pandas APIs (tabular inputs/outputs) can now be directly integrated into Workshop applications, meaning you no longer need to have a translation layer from a Pandas dataframe to parameters in TypeScript. Relatedly, models with parameter input and outputs continue to be supported.\n\nFor other API shapes, models can be published with an API name so they can still be used in TypeScript repositories where needed, such as when enabling the usage of a function that cannot be consumed by Workshop directly.\n\nPublishing a function from a Model Deployment.\n\nNotably improved stability and faster startup times\n\nWe have also incorporated the use of fully containerized models, a major change to the Modeling infrastructure, meaning that models are now a Docker image with the full model environment, adapter instance, and model weights all patched together, ensuring faster startup times. Additionally, containerized images do not require any connection to the Palantir platform to launch. During internal testing, model deployments became fully ready in just one minute, whereas live deployments took three - compressed startup times become increasingly impactful within large, complex environments.\n\nGuaranteed inference type safety\n\nWe are now able to guarantee inference type safety by using Apache Arrow to communicate with the model's container. This ensures that a userâs inference inputs are being passed to their model adapter logic in exactly the method specified within the model adapterâs API. For example, if the modelâs API declares an integer parameter to be supplied, the input value will be either cast as an integer, or thrown if the value cannot be cast successfully. Additionally, date-time and timestamp values will now pass safely and accurately.\n\nOpen model with incorrect type error message.\n\nDebug Mode with practical flame graph visualization\n\nDirect model deployments now boasts a new debugging feature - the ability to create and view a full flame graph of a modelâs inference - empowering you to see different parts of the model interact. By leveraging this new view, you can now gain insight into exactly what parts of code are slower than expected, allowing you to iteratively optimize model performance more easily than before.\n\nFlame graph view for a Model Deployment inference query.\n\nGet started with model deployments\n\nTo benefit from these features above, make sure to publish a new model version for your model using the latest `palantir_models` library. Note that the feature set is not yet available for on-premise stacks, and that not all model types are supported by model deployments. External models and SparkML models are currently excluded.\n\n[To get started, review our model deployment guide.](../manage-models/create-a-model-deployment.md)","application":{"id":"model-integration","title":"Modeling"},"category":{"id":"model-integration","title":"Model Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"f172de89ec7ebe991814c2532682fa7f5418b569c5edd29c0fbd24f26217bf94","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Action types will now show usage metrics on Ontology Manager's overview page.","categoryTitle":"Ontology","categoryId":"ontology","applicationId":"ontology-manager","applicationTitle":"Ontology Management","date":"September 12, 2024","title":"GA action metrics","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"ontology","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"ontology-manager","title":"Ontology Management"},"category":{"id":"ontology","title":"Ontology"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"September 12, 2024"},{"id":"b9f0f315-e1c9-457b-9d91-306fa7d4a270","releaseNotes":[{"id":"2429fd768d4f0578780d82d22d5a1355b8b525cd3de38c7d8b91e693af00ec4b","type":"FEATURE","description":"Quiver time series charts now allow plot visibility to be controlled by a parameter or card output variable.

Interfaces provide object type polymorphism, allowing for consistent modeling of and interaction with object types that share a common shape.\n\nInterfaces are composed of [shared properties](../object-link-types/shared-property-overview.md), [interface link types,](../interfaces/interface-link-types-overview.md) and [metadata](../interfaces/interface-metadata.md) about the interface. An interface can be implemented by multiple object types and can be extended to allow for composability of interfaces.\n\nAn example `Facility` interface in Ontology Manager.\n\n### The power of interfaces\n\nFor data integrators, an interface can represent a pipeline target for integrating similar but distinct object types. For application developers, an interface can serve as an API surface for accessing all implementing object types.\n\nImplementing an interface with an object type indicates that that object type is a concrete instance of the interface within the Ontology. This declaration allows additional functionality on the object type, namely:\n\n- [Object Set Service](../object-backend/overviewmd#object-set-service-oss) searches against the interface will return matching objects of the implementing object type.\n- Users can interact with objects of the implementing object type using both their local API names when typed as the concrete object type and the interface API names for properties and links when typed as the interface type.\n\nIn short, implementing an interface allows downstream applications to interact with any and all implementing objects through the interface definition. This allows users to write application code using the interface as an API layer, instead of requiring the application to support every implementing object type individually. Additionally, by using the interface as an application API layer, new object types can be added to the application by having them implement the application interface without requiring code changes to explicitly support the new object type.\n\n### Example interface: Scheduling\n\nA common use case for interfaces is to indicate that an object type has a certain capability, for example to indicate that an object represents a schedulable event. By implementing the `Schedulable Event` interface, an object can be used by Ontology-aware apps for dynamic scheduling workflows, calendar management, and more.\n\nAn example `Schedulable Event` interface, implemented on the `Flight` object type with shared `Start Time` and `End Time` properties.\n\n### Get started with interfaces\n\nTo add interfaces to your Ontology, you can [create](../interfaces/create-interface.md) new interfaces or [extend](../interfaces/extend-interface.md) existing ones in Ontology Manager. Once you have an interface, you can then [implement](../interfaces/implement-interface.md) that interface with an object type of the appropriate shape or [edit](../interfaces/edit-interface-definition.md) it to better fit your Organization as your Ontology evolves.\n\nOnce your interface is declared, you can package and install them with [Marketplace,](../marketplace/overview.md) implement them in [Pipeline Builder](../pipeline-builder/overview.md), and use them as your API in [Ontology SDK](../ontology-sdk/overview.md) applications.\n\nTo learn more about interfaces and how to use them, review our [interface documentation](../interfaces/interfaces-overview.md).\n\n### What's next on the development roadmap?\n\nAs we work to make interface types generally available, we will extend support for interfaces as inputs to Actions, Functions, and Workshop widgets.","application":{"id":"ontology-manager","title":"Ontology Management"},"category":{"id":"ontology","title":"Ontology"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"August 27, 2024"},{"id":"3ac45f78-1498-4cd9-91b6-f189c334626b","releaseNotes":[{"id":"97a7a3bc-6f27-41df-bc77-21de98272c2d","type":"FIX","description":"The pagination within the \"Analysis\" tab now retains the current page after viewing the usage details for an individual resource.","categoryTitle":"Administration","categoryId":"administration","applicationId":"resource-management","applicationTitle":"Resource Management","date":"August 23, 2024","title":"Improved Resource Analysis Pagination","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"resource-management-app","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"resource-management","title":"Resource Management"},"category":{"id":"administration","title":"Administration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"c55f4128e7939d5fe69b0dfd667f1b2001fbec69686a37cbca68b3bb05a52a23","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Fixed an issue where filtering on the property type selector would not correctly filter the list of available options.\n","categoryTitle":"Ontology","categoryId":"ontology","applicationId":"ontology-manager","applicationTitle":"Ontology Management","date":"August 23, 2024","title":"Fixed home page filter for base types","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"ontology","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"ontology-manager","title":"Ontology Management"},"category":{"id":"ontology","title":"Ontology"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"August 23, 2024"},{"id":"ee619762-ac70-4c74-83f3-288a77b08853","releaseNotes":[{"id":"63272979-9623-4d0c-a070-1d7e2ea49f3e","type":"FEATURE","description":"Users can now navigate to the latest public announcements and release notes from Foundry using the **Platform updates** link available in the **Support** menu of the [workspace sidebar](/foundry/getting-started/orientation-and-nav#the-sidebar).","categoryTitle":"Administration","categoryId":"administration","applicationId":"","applicationTitle":"Workspace","date":"August 22, 2024","title":"View platform updates from the workspace sidebar","prominence":"Highlight","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"","mediaFilenames":["/docs/resources/foundry/announcements/release-notes/1723570214148-20240813_foundry_workspace_support_menu.png"],"application":{"id":"","title":"Workspace"},"category":{"id":"administration","title":"Administration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"b66eadf9-cd07-48be-a3ad-ad06c430b164","type":"FEATURE","description":"To improve your navigation and editing experience, you can now create folders and subfolders in Pipeline Builder.

From there, you can create and fine tune unit tests by selecting the relevant nodes and providing input and output datasets.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 4.47.02â¯PM.png](../pipeline-builder/dataexpectations-unit-tests.md)\n\n*The Unit tests icon on the right side panel.*\n\nAfter you have configured a unit test and created input and output datasets, you can run your test by selecting **Run test**. Expected and received outputs will be displayed, allowing you to assess results and iterate on your pipeline or unit tests if necessary, all in one place.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 4.52.24â¯PM.png](../pipeline-builder/dataexpectations-unit-tests.md)\n\n*A sample unit test result, displaying test results and configuration on the right and expected and received outputs on the bottom.*\n\nAs part of this flexible and fully-featured testing interface, you can easily edit and delete unit tests to keep up with rapidly evolving pipelines. Changes to unit tests will also show up in the proposals page, allowing you to track changes and ensure that all tests are passing before merging proposals.\n\n[Learn more about unit testing in Pipeline Builder.](../pipeline-builder/dataexpectations-unit-tests.md)","application":{"id":"pipeline-builder","title":"Pipeline Builder"},"category":{"id":"data-integration","title":"Data Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"August 20, 2024"},{"id":"2fd92d92-41d1-4456-a0b5-73702621ca62","releaseNotes":[{"id":"d525272a9dd9eadbcd1067b3c846daed148eafaf1164a4505ee6668dc8889b9e","type":"FEATURE","description":"Slate now introduces an alert mechanism to notify users before exiting edit mode if unsaved changes are present, safeguarding against accidental data loss.","categoryTitle":"App Building","categoryId":"app-building","applicationId":"slate","applicationTitle":"Slate","date":"August 17, 2024","title":"Alert for Unsaved Edits in Slate","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"slate","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"slate","title":"Slate"},"category":{"id":"app-building","title":"App Building"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"August 17, 2024"},{"id":"8498606c-cde9-42b6-8a46-fcbd8f6650d3","releaseNotes":[{"id":"8eaade01-8ab5-4973-9c60-0c18dee42d7c","type":"FEATURE","description":"[Value types](/foundry/object-link-types/value-types-overview/) are now generally available, providing semantic wrappers around field types that include metadata and constraints to enhance type safety, expressiveness, and context.

These value types can be reused across multiple object types and pipelines in the platform, with no need to duplicate validation logic. You can easily create and manage value types through the new Value Types application, then apply them to properties in your Ontology using the [Ontology Manager](../ontology-manager/overview.md). With their move to general availability, you can now also package and install value types in [Marketplace](../marketplace/overview.md) for use in your Marketplace products.\n\n![The Value Types application, displaying available value types in a given namespace.](image.png)\n\nAdd user-defined semantic types\n\nWith value types, you can capture the context and semantic meaning of data while centralizing data validation. You can intuitively define and consume meaning directly from the value type without relying on information like column names or property descriptions. Value types also enforce validation constraints on data in Pipeline Builder pipelines and the Ontology, allowing data integrators and ontology managers to ensure proper semantic typing in their data flows and models.\n\nFor example, you can define an `email` value type that has a regular expression constraint to ensure that any property using the value type represents a valid email address. This value type can then be reused across multiple object types and pipelines, without needing to duplicate the validation logic for every given property. Additionally, each property that uses this value type is explicitly understood to contain an email address.\n\nUse value types in the platform\n\nOnce you [create a value type](../object-link-types/create-value-type.md), you can use it to provide data validation across Foundry. You can use value types in a variety of use cases:\n\n- Assigning a value type to an object type property\n- Assigning a value type to a shared property\n- Assigning a value type to a Pipeline Builder pipeline property as a logical type, using the  `logical type cast` expression and selecting the value type on the property when you write to the objects target.\n\nTo assign a value type to a property, select the value type from the dropdown menu during property configuration.\n\n![The value type selector in Ontology Manager, allowing a user to assign a value type to a property.](valuetypes2.png)\n\nValue types packaged in a Marketplace product.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Why am I receiving this message?**  \nIf you have received this message, your email address is registered in the [Foundry Control Panel settings for **Contact information**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/platform-communications/index.html) as a recipient for at least one of the communication types (platform administration, user support, service disruption announcements, or security updates).\n\n**Foundry product lifecycle announcements:**  \nWe will share updates through the Support desk communications channel if Foundry products change status in the development lifecycle (e.g. beta, general availability, sunset, or deprecation).

Note that the following are not currently supported: struct nesting (for example, inside a `person` struct, you cannot have another struct `bestFriend`), and struct arrays.\n\nStruct variable `student1` is backed by a function that returns fields `name`, `birthday`, `studentId`, `isGraduated`, `isHonors` of field types `string`, `date`, `number`, `boolean`, `boolean`, respectively. Unsupported field `bestFriend` which is a type of nested struct is not yet supported and is omitted.\n\n**Extract fields from struct variables to display in widgets**\n\nAs widgets and variable transformation operations cannot use structs as a whole, extract individual struct fields for use. The image below shows how the string type `name` field is extracted from the `person` struct variable using an [extract struct field variable transform](../workshop/variable-transformations.md), and then used in a [Metric card widget](../workshop/widgets-metric-card.md).\n\nField `name` on struct variable `student1` is extracted into a string variable and displayed on a Metric card widget.\n\n**Pass struct variables as inputs to functions**\n\nFinally, understand that struct variables can also be used as inputs to functions. When configuring a function that uses a struct as an input, the required fields of the struct input may be previewed by hovering over the `Preview schema` label. In doing so, application builders can easily verify that the expected input schema matches that of the selected struct variable by referencing it to the struct variable's raw `Current value`.\n\nA function that returns a list of common course codes shared by the two students takes in two student structs as inputs.\n\n[Review the documentation on struct variables in Workshop.](../workshop/struct-variables.md)","application":{"id":"workshop","title":"Workshop"},"category":{"id":"app-building","title":"App Building"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"1a244343-5a61-4473-bac8-2bb597f7563c","type":"FEATURE","description":"Sources with egress policies are now visually integrated into the Data Lineage downstream flow, offering improved insights into data movement.","categoryTitle":"Data Integration","categoryId":"data-integration","applicationId":"data-lineage","applicationTitle":"Data Lineage","date":"August 6, 2024","title":"Egress policy integration in Data Lineage","prominence":"Highlight","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"monocle","mediaFilenames":["/docs/resources/foundry/announcements/release-notes/1722449939912-egress-policies-in-data-lineage.png"],"application":{"id":"data-lineage","title":"Data Lineage"},"category":{"id":"data-integration","title":"Data Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"bbfbbefbc77ffd414e18301c94a27bb2d29d7a4646036777e9e89152bfde3b4c","type":"FEATURE","description":"The Data Lineage tool now includes a comprehensive display of egress policies, offering users a detailed view of data connections and their governance.","categoryTitle":"Data Integration","categoryId":"data-integration","applicationId":"data-lineage","applicationTitle":"Data Lineage","date":"August 6, 2024","title":"Enhanced Egress Policy Integration in Data Lineage","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"monocle","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"data-lineage","title":"Data Lineage"},"category":{"id":"data-integration","title":"Data Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"51957331f6802c591cc73a32f9da52b0eb6f0c9963806dfe9c25817821ad35be","type":"FEATURE","description":"Users can now observe egress policies within Data Lineage, offering a comprehensive view of data connections and aiding governance.","categoryTitle":"Security","categoryId":"security","applicationId":"projects","applicationTitle":"Projects","date":"August 6, 2024","title":"Enhanced Data Lineage Egress Policy Display","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"compass","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"projects","title":"Projects"},"category":{"id":"security","title":"Security"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"August 6, 2024"},{"id":"818c014b-45ac-4f13-98ef-d6323de54900","releaseNotes":[{"id":"e93e57d15357569668a6ed584dd3f9b588690bccc474cd40076b5b7b2d9adc59","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"This change allows users to specify that different unique identifier logic rule values should use the same generated UUID.

When an application transitions from one lifecycle stage to the next, the same set of users maintain access. This is now the case even when an application moves through multiple lifecycle stages without admin review.\n\nThere are only two cases where the effective access to an application changes automatically:\n\n- When an application becomes **generally available**, all users get access to it automatically - _unless_ the application has been explicitly disabled during the experimental or beta stage. Applications that will automatically get enabled upon reaching general availability are now shown as `Not yet enabled` rather than `Disabled` in Application access to indicate this state.\n  \n  ![Image (4).jpg](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.62610df6-61f7-438c-8d9c-4332d0be740c)\n\n- When an application is **deprecated**, all users will lose access to it.\n\nWith these improvements, the previous `Needs review` callout at the top of the page is getting replaced with more targeted callouts for significant application lifecycle updates:\n\n- **Generally available applications that were previously disabled**: Applications that were explicitly disabled or restricted to certain user groups during the experimental or beta stage remain restricted when those applications reach general availability. There are quick actions to either keep the restriction or enable the application for all users in its new lifecycle stage.\n  \n  ![Image (3).jpg](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.5a7bfca8-12a6-42b6-ba6d-fc7e837f3868)\n\n- **Recently-sunset applications that are enabled**: When an application enters the sunset stage, users who had access before continue to maintain access.

Previous lifecycle stage access settings no longer need to be reconfirmed every time an application progresses to the next stage. Now, there are only two scenarios where access changes automatically: when an application becomes generally available (unless explicitly disabled during the experimental or beta stage) and when an application is deprecated.\n\nThese improvements replace the previous `Needs review` callout with more targeted notifications for significant application lifecycle updates: Generally available applications that were previously disabled or restricted, applications that recently entered the sunset stage, and deprecated applications that are still enabled. Each of these offer quick actions to reconfirm the effective access setting or switch to the recommended setting, streamlining the user access management process.\n\nFor more information, reference [our documentation updates on these improvements](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/configure-application-access/#lifecycle-stage-updates).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Why am I receiving this message?**\n \nIf you have received this message, your email address is registered in the [Foundry Control Panel settings for **Contact information**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/platform-communications/index.html) as a recipient for at least one of the communication types (platform administration, user support, service disruption announcements, or security updates). \n\n**Foundry product lifecycle announcements:**\nWe will share updates through the Support desk communications channel if Foundry products change status in the development lifecycle (e.g. beta, general availability, sunset, or deprecation).

Internal tests show a reduction in computation times from 40 seconds to 1 second, speeding up resource intensive previews by 40x. This feature is now generally available on all enrollments.\n\n### Faster previews powered by caching improvements\n\nCaching improvements now allow nodes in Pipeline Builder to use cached, or \"stored\" results from upstream nodes that have already been previewed. This allows downstream nodes to skip recomputes and swiftly display your data previews.\n\nPipeline Builder's improved caching features include:\n\n- **Decreased redundant computations**: Previews in Pipeline Builder now only compute additional nodes when previewing downstream of cached nodes.\n- **Efficient caching**: Computationally expensive nodes such as joins and `use LLM` are now proactively cached, allowing downstream nodes to avoid repetitive and time consuming computations.\n\nUsers will benefit from snappy previews and decreased processing costs, saving time and resources when working downstream of expensive nodes. A lightning bolt icon will appear on previews that use cached upstream preview results, as shown below:\n\n![A preview in Pipeline Builder showing the lightning bolt icon in the preview table.](Pipeline_Builder_lightning_icon.png)\n\n### Understanding improved node caching\n\nBefore this change, if you previewed a node twice without any logic changes, it would cache the results from the first preview and reuse them for the second preview. If you then previewed a downstream node, it would not have access to other cached node results. Upstream nodes needed to be recomputed from scratch.\n\nNow, all node previews in Pipeline Builder can make use of cached results, so only additional downstream nodes need to be computed.\n\nTake the following example dataset:\n\n![A flow chart representing a dataset and its downstream nodes A through D.](Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 12.51.42â¯PM.png)\n\nIf you preview `C`, nodes `Dataset â A â B â C` are computed. Before this change, if you then preview `D`:\n\n- Nodes `Dataset â A â B â C` are recomputed, in addition to `D`.\n\nAfter this change, if you preview `D` after `C`:\n\n- Only nodes `C â D` are computed, because node `D` can now use cached results from node `C`.\n\nNote that all node previews compute up to 500 rows. Operations that will not benefit from this feature include operations that change row counts, joins, aggregations, or changes in logic.\n\n[Learn more about Pipeline Builder previews.](../pipeline-builder/outputs-preview-pipeline.md)","application":{"id":"pipeline-builder","title":"Pipeline Builder"},"category":{"id":"data-integration","title":"Data Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"53700a5a152feb429899974faec6a51c521ecbdce9afd0acd9d659070428038c","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Ontology builders can now setup user-driven object types in a much easier way.

With support for the latest generative AI models, AIP Accelerate is a sandbox for wielding the capabilities of LLMs for investigative business workflows.\n\n*AIP Accelerate landing page.*\n\nA LLM's response effectiveness highly depends on the contextual environment. AIP Accelerate enables you to carefully manage what context the LLM is given by usingÂ *Context Threads*. Context threads are one of the primary components of Accelerate, and denote a chain of information that is provided to a large language model. Cells pass information downward, via a context thread, to their sub-cells. Workflow builders can use context threads to break out of the linear-chat motif and engineer workflows that are not limited by a single context path. Furthermore, AIP Accelerate leverages primitives within the platform to enable operations on various forms of structured and unstructured data (such as tabular data, PDF, or image files) to do complex analysis.Â \n\n*AIP Accelerate context thread where the child LLM cell inherits the context of its parent, continuing the conversation.*\n\nIn the image above, we have a two-cell context thread. We can continue nesting cells to drill into a conversation with an LLM, or branch off after any cell and go down a different path. \n\n### Secure and customizable AI-powered analysis\n\nThe key features of AIP Accelerate include:\n\n- **User-friendly interface**: AIP Accelerate has an intuitive interface that makes it easy for workflow builders to construct complex, multi-dimensional analysis using LLMs.\n- **Generative AI models**: Customize which available LLMs to use when executing both text and vision based tasks.\n- **Operate on real data**: Deploy LLMs over data within the platform such as datasets or mediasets (images or PDF documents).\n- **Share results**: Save analysis results as a new dataset for use in other AIP tools or share a workflow with other users.\n- **Data security**: AIP Accelerate is built on the same rigorous [security](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/security/overview/) model that governs the rest of the Palantir platform, including user based data permissions. These platform security controls grant an LLM access only to what is necessary to complete a task.\n\nAIP Accelerate is under active development and support for more operations are coming soon.\n\n### Access AIP Accelerate\n\nAIP Accelerate can be accessed from the platformâs workspace navigation bar or by using the quick search shortcuts `CMD + J` (macOS) or `CTRL + J` (Windows). Alternatively, you can create a new workflow from yourÂ **Files**Â by selectingÂ **+New** and then choosingÂ **Accelerate**, as shown below.\n\n*The Foundry app navigation menu.*\n\nLearn more about AIP Accelerate in our documentation.\n\n---\n\nDraft Foghorn Here [Docs Team Only]\n\n*Only required for application-level announcements (check \"type\" field in metadata).*\n\n[Foundry product lifecycle](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/development-life-cycle/) announcement*\n\nTitle: AIP Accelerate (BETA) [Coming soon]\n\nAIP Accelerate is a notebook environment for building large language model (LLM) powered workflows.

Migrating your code to this new version will help you get ready for TypeScript 2.0.\n\n### Why are we developing TypeScript 2.0?\n\nTo benefit from new Ontology primitives such as Ontology interfaces, real-time subscription, and have a more efficient way to work with data, we refactored the OSDK TypeScript semantics. This change will be labeled as major release v2.0, to be released before the end of 2024.\n\nPrior to the release of version 2.0, we are aiming to minimize the impact for customers by first providing version 1.1 and 1.2 as a bridge to the upcoming upgrade.\n\nTo clarify, the next two upcoming versions are detailed below:\n\n- **Version 1.1** - This version maintains the current language syntax but will deprecate a few methods and properties which are not going to be supported moving forward.\n\n- **Version 1.2** - Released later this year, version 1.2 will mainly provide the same functionality as the 1.x version but will introduce the new language syntax.\n\n### What will change in OSDK TypeScript 1.1?\n\nThe following table is a summary of deprecated features and their replacements, with more detailed info on the changes below:\n\n| Deprecated       | Replacement                |\n|------------------|----------------------------|\n| page             | fetchPage, fetchPageWithErrors |\n| __apiName        | $apiName                   |\n| __primaryKey     | $primaryKey                |\n| __rid            | $rid                       |\n| all()            | asyncIter()                |\n| bulkActions      | batchActions               |\n| searchAround{linkApiName} | pivotTo(linkApiName) |\n\n### Page()\n\nWe are deprecating the `page` function, and adding the following two methods for convenience:\n\n- `fetchPageWithErrors`\n  - This functions exactly like `page` did, it is just a rename for consistency with API naming conventions in V2.0 to come.\n  - **Before**\n    - ```javascript\n      const result: Result\u003cEmployee[], ListObjectsError\u003e = await client.ontology\n      .objects.Employee.page();\n\n      if(isOk(result)){\n      const employees = result.value.data;\n      }\n      ```\n  - **After**\n    - ```javascript\n      const result: Result\u003cEmployee[], ListObjectsError\u003e = await client.ontology\n      .objects.Employee.fetchPageWithErrors();\n\n      if(isOk(result)){\n      const employees = result.value.data;\n      }\n      ```\n\n- `fetchPage`\n  - This will return a page that does not have a result wrapper (no `Result\u003cValue,Error\u003e` )\n  - This was added to for users who prefer the `try/catch` pattern as it will throw errors where relevant.\n  - **Before**\n    - Same as above\n  - **After**\n    - ```javascript\n      try{\n      const result: Result\u003cEmployee[], ListObjectsError\u003e = await client.ontology\n      .objects.Employee.fetchPageWithErrors();\n      const employees = result.value.data;\n\n      } catch(e) {\n      console.error(e);\n      }\n      ```\n\n### apiName, primaryKey, rid\n\nWe are deprecating `__apiName`, `__primaryKey` and `__rid` properties and replacing them with `$apiName`, `$primaryKey` and `$rid` properties.\n\n### All()\n\nWe are deprecating `all()` method and added the following convenience method instead:\n\n- `asyncIter()`\n  - This returns an async iterator that will allow you to iterate through all results of your object set\n  - **Before**\n    - ```javascript\n      const result: Result\u003cEmployee[], ListObjectsError\u003e = await client.ontology\n      .objects.Employee.all();\n\n      if(isOk(result)){\n      const employees = result.value.data\n      }\n      ```\n  - **After**\n    - ```javascript\n      const employees: Employee[] = await Array.fromAsync(await client.ontology.objects.Employee.asyncIter());\n      ```\n\n### BulkActions\n\nWe are deprecating `bulkActions` and renaming it to `batchActions` This is a rename which matches the REST API name.\n\n- **Before**\n  - `await client.ontology.bulkActions.doAction([...])`\n- **After**\n  - `await client.ontology.batchActions.doAction([...])`\n\n### SearchArounds\n\nWe are deprecating `searchAround{linkApiName}` and replacing it with:\n\n- `pivotTo(linkApiName)`\n  - This will function exactly the same as search around but the name will better reflect that the result is of the type of the object you pivoted to.\n  - **Before**\n    - `await client.ontology.objects.testObject.where(...).searchAroundLinkedObject().page()`\n  - **After**\n    - `await client.ontology.objects.testObject.where(...).pivotTo(\"linkedObject\").fetchPage()`\n\n### How can I try this out?\n\nAfter the updated generator version is released, when you create a new SDK version for your application using the [Developer Console](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/ontology-sdk/overview/), the produced version will contain these features. Once you update the dependencies in your application, you will see the deprecated methods and properties with a cross over line `searchAroundLinkedObject()` BUT the code will still function as before. In version 2.0, we will drop the support for the deprecated methods.\n\nYou can also decide to use an older version of the generator by using the dropdown list using the **Generate new version**\noption.\n\n### Whatâs coming next?\n\nAs a summary of the above, the OSDK TypeScript versions to come are as follows:\n\n- **Version 1.1** - This version maintains the current language syntax but will deprecate a few methods and properties which are not going to be supported moving forward.\n\n- **Version 1.2** - Released later this year, version 1.2 will introduce the new language syntax.\n\n- **Version 2.0** - Will mark the new language syntax as general availability (GA), while dropping support for the deprecated methods and properties and introduce new capabilities which are not available yet.","application":{"id":"ontology-sdk","title":"Ontology SDK"},"category":{"id":"dev-toolchain","title":"Developer Toolchain"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"40177d7b6bcb0691868992ade2510fb258999a2ef3f656e49ba78df8c058776e","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Ontology Manager now only loads the Ontology resources most relevant to the user rather than the full Ontology, significantly improving startup time.","categoryTitle":"Ontology","categoryId":"ontology","applicationId":"ontology-manager","applicationTitle":"Ontology Management","date":"May 9, 2024","title":"Lazy loads GA","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"ontology","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"ontology-manager","title":"Ontology Management"},"category":{"id":"ontology","title":"Ontology"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"e48f22dd0b9c2a0405e007167d2f62c7154862b3b1617c0494ba35bd40324db2","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Added integration with Approvals for namespace retention policy changes or additions.

The new **code** tool helps answer complex coding questions, and a **TypeScript compiler** is now in use to improve TypeScript code and flag issues with initially proposed code. This is now available on all enrollments.\n\n### Get accurate, Palantir-specific code\n\nWith the new AIP Assist code tool, we are now able to return answers with accurate, Palantir-specific code for several applications and features. For example, you can ask an Ontology-focused question (\"how can I write an Ontology edit function?\"), or ask about a specific language (\"how can I parse raw files in parallel in a Python transform?\"). Previously, AIP Assist could provide answers using generic, non-Palantir code that presented general use cases. With these improvements, developers will be able to receive accurate, specific code that directly supports their workflow in Code Repositories.\n\nOn introduction, the code tool in AIP Assist supports the following languages:\n- Python\n- TypeScript\n- SQL\n- PySpark\n- [Contour expression language](../contour/expressions-overview.md)\n\n![AIP Assist Code Tool.png](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.64cc56c7-a334-49c5-9f5e-4247d752d4c8)\n\n*The new code tool improves code responses in AIP Assist.*\n\nThe new code tool will continue to improve the developer experience in AIP Assist as Palantir engineers update and expand our collections of code examples; the examples, [now available in our public documentation](../code-examples/notional-data-generation-transforms.md), will provide use case guidance and inspiration for solving complex problems and transformations.\n\n### Fix compiler errors in the moment\n\nAIP Assist is now also integrated with the TypeScript compiler to flag issue with type mismatches, unhandled promises, and more. Once AIP Assist generates an initial code in response to questions, the code will pass through the compiler to find errors and allow users to commit changes directly in the Assist interface.\n\n![image (21).png](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.0dd14854-ba13-47f7-b136-7cdf26db5874)\n\n*Compile Typescript errors directly in AIP Assist.*\n\nAs the TypeScript compiler works, AIP Assist receives feedback that iteratively refines the generated code. The compiler adjusts types, adds missing type definitions, corrects promise handling, and ensures the code adheres to TypeScript's strict typing. Each iteration is re-checked by the compiler until the code compiles without errors.\n\nAIP Assist not only solves immediate problems with code, but also provides insight into developers on how to avoid similar issues in the future.\n\nLearn more about [the AIP features](../docs/foundry/code-repositories/aip-features/) you can use to improve your developer experience.","application":{"id":"","title":"AIP Assist"},"category":{"id":"platform-overview","title":"AIP"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"1f26af1e-9867-4532-9980-a3b9f7bb5d73","type":"FEATURE","description":"Variable Transforms now support casting between Date, Timestamp, Number, and String types.","categoryTitle":"App Building","categoryId":"app-building","applicationId":"workshop","applicationTitle":"Workshop","date":"May 6, 2024","title":"[Workshop] Support Casting as a Variable Transform","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"workshop-app","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"workshop","title":"Workshop"},"category":{"id":"app-building","title":"App Building"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"May 6, 2024"},{"id":"d123d1ee-2f70-4818-b906-fec3cf83b83c","releaseNotes":[{"id":"23472d89e7974714042c8f996268e3893aeee6d18540ff0b5a68af8dcec63148","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Ontology Manager has been upgraded to facilitate the establishment of alternative designations, or aliases, for object types, enhancing the ability to locate objects when precise names are not known.","categoryTitle":"Ontology","categoryId":"ontology","applicationId":"ontology-manager","applicationTitle":"Ontology Management","date":"May 4, 2024","title":"Improved Alias Creation in Ontology Manager","prominence":"Highlight","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"ontology","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"ontology-manager","title":"Ontology Management"},"category":{"id":"ontology","title":"Ontology"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"May 4, 2024"},{"id":"52ef224d-e5cf-4a70-8076-f1d81b40513e","releaseNotes":[{"id":"33f664e9-4689-435a-accc-21365fb1f489","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Users can now directly observe downstream usage of functions within AIP Logic files, enhancing the ease of tracing function impact.

Loop layouts allow for flexible display of a sorted object set, by using each object in the set as a module interface input to display an embedded module for each object. This new layout type expands the capabilities of embedding Workshop modules to now be dynamic to the objects in a given object set.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 10.28.08â¯AM](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.fc1bebdd-70a4-48a5-92d4-5a325a6781cf)\n\n*New **Loop** layout option shown in the layout selector.*\n\nWorkshop builders may wish to use the loop layout option for more control over the display of an object set than what is offered by other object set display widgets, such as the object table or object list. While other object set display widgets come with a fixed set of features, the loop layout allows builders to use any feature combination available in Workshop to display each object in the object set.\n\nBelow is an example of a loop layout to create interactive ticket cards for each object in three object sets (one per column), to create a kanban style application. Each ticket card is an embedded module instance populated with an object from the object set provided to the column's loop layout. In this embedded module, full layout control is available, and builders can configure exactly what to display, and what actions are available for each object. This offers greater flexibility than what is offered by other object set display widgets.\n\n![loop-layout-in-use.png](ri.notepad.main.snapshot.55c841a5-ca8f-493e-9dae-0f4d0622bb4e)\n\n*Three loop layouts used to set up priority triage workflow.*\n\nLoop layouts feature similar section styling options as other Workshop layouts, with the ability to configure padding and border style. Additionally, loop layouts offer two pagination styles, a pagination footer to page through a large object set, and a limit option to display a configured fixed number of objects from the sorted object set.\n\nFor more detail, review the [loop layouts documentation](../workshop/loop-layouts.md).","application":{"id":"workshop","title":"Workshop"},"category":{"id":"app-building","title":"App Building"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"9a45e4eefe55eae08f6468de46b616e0ea77e3e3e974f649b351e4fa82a3c43f","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"Object tables in Workshop now uniformly display \"No value\" for both linked object property columns and direct object property columns when the value is null, ensuring consistency across the application.","categoryTitle":"App Building","categoryId":"app-building","applicationId":"workshop","applicationTitle":"Workshop","date":"March 28, 2024","title":"Uniform Handling of Null Entries in Object Tables","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"workshop-app","mediaFilenames":[],"application":{"id":"workshop","title":"Workshop"},"category":{"id":"app-building","title":"App Building"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}},{"id":"09f52ea0-0d8f-4624-89dc-a711762b1f6d","type":"FEATURE","description":"It is now possible to upgrade a model's model adapter without retraining or republishing the underlying model files by selecting **Upgrade Model Adapter** button in the model page.","categoryTitle":"Model Integration","categoryId":"model-integration","applicationId":"model-integration","applicationTitle":"Modeling","date":"March 28, 2024","title":"Support upgrading model adapters from the models page","prominence":"Basic","releaseVersion":"","productId":"Foundry","frontendApplicationId":"ml","mediaFilenames":["/docs/resources/foundry/announcements/release-notes/1711357829688-6cf90421-ee86-44a2-8bd4-7697a9ad708f.png"],"application":{"id":"model-integration","title":"Modeling"},"category":{"id":"model-integration","title":"Model Integration"},"product":{"id":"Foundry"}}],"date":"March 28, 2024"},{"id":"3211f2f6-9c79-4c06-aae2-43b84b30483e","releaseNotes":[{"id":"6ba1214cf384ca41f02bfebb029b86cf623647c3db5363550f9efbb3bfe94474","type":"ENHANCEMENT","description":"The Pipeline Builder has been updated to present a more intuitive error message when a deployment is hindered by a cycle error, specifically when an output is incorrectly utilized as an input.
