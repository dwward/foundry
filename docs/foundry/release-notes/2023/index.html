Users can now create a vector property type for objects in the Ontology and use a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) function on objects (FoO) to enable semantic search over objects, making it possible to use the outputs of models leveraging the Ontology for more accurate results.\n\nAn example use case is an improved experience for documentation base users searching for a specific topic; support for semantic search means that a user's query can be matched with its semantic meaning and return related objects. Additionally, with access to the Ontology, these results can then be piped back into the LLM to generate a useful user-friendly prompt boosting existing AIP builder features.\n\n### What is semantic search?\n\nSemantic search is a search which uses the context of the query to return improved search results, in comparison to keyword search which simply matches whole phrases from a query regardless of context.\n\nSupport for semantic search is made possible by the following enhancements made to the Ontology:\n\n- Introduction of vector property type in Object Storage V2 (OSv2)\n- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) searches through functions on objects\n\nGenerate a vector property from a float array obtained from a Foundry modeling objective to then allow searches using KNN in a FoO function for similar vectors. For a detailed end-to-end semantic search workflow example, refer to the [KNN workflow tutorial](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/create-an-end-to-end-knn-workflow/index.html).\n\n### Configure a vector property type\n\nThe new vector type can be used to capture embeddings from models into the Ontology. These can be created on any float array dataset field of fixed dimension. There are a few similarity functions to compare vectors that can be chosen based on use case and model output.\n\nFrom within Ontology Manager, you can configure the vector property, starting with a type, choosing the dimension (output length of model that this is based on), and then selecting the similarity function that decides how you want to compare this vector property type with other objects that have the same vector property type.\n\n### K-nearest neighbors functions on objects\n\nThe new KNN FoO function support makes it simple to create a function to semantically query an object type. A live model-generated vector or existing vector from an object can be used to perform the KNN search over the object type. Review additional information on [KNN FoO functions in the documentation](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/api-object-sets/index.html#k-nearest-neighbors).\n\nFinally, you can review topics related to this announcement in Foundry documentation:\n\n- [Create an end-to-end semantic search workflow](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/create-an-end-to-end-knn-workflow/index.html)\n- [K-nearest neighbors in API: Object sets](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/api-object-sets/index.html#k-nearest-neighbors)\n- [Vector property type limitations](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/api-objects-links#object-property-metadata)\n\n---\n\n### Support for semantic search in Foundry is now available [GA]\n\nPalantir Foundry now supports semantic search in the Ontology with the introduction of vector properties and functions. Users can now create a vector property type for objects in the Ontology and use a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) function on objects (FoO) to enable semantic search over objects, making it possible to use the outputs of models leveraging the Ontology for more accurate results.\n\nFor more on topics related to this announcement, review the following:\n\n- [Create an end-to-end semantic search workflow](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/create-an-end-to-end-knn-workflow/index.html)\n- [K-nearest neighbors in API: Object sets](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/api-object-sets/index.html#k-nearest-neighbors)\n- [Vector property type limitations](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/functions/api-objects-links#object-property-metadata)\n\n---\n\n**Why am I receiving this message?**  \nIf you have received this message, your email address is registered in the [Foundry Control Panel settings for Contact information](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/platform-communications/index.html) as a recipient for at least one of the communication types (platform administration, user support, service disruption announcements, or security updates).\n\n**Foundry product lifecycle announcements:**  \nWe will share updates through the Support desk communications channel if Foundry products change status in the development lifecycle (e.g. beta, general availability, sunset, or deprecation).

Marketplace can power workflows such as:\n\n* Installing a Workshop-based task management application across different departments in your organization with each organization's input data.\n* Installing a data connector and Ontology to enable your customers to onboard their own data to Foundry and participate in an ecosystem. \n* Installing a Pipeline Builder pipeline in your pre-production and production environments to facilitate controlled release management workflows. \n\n![Browse Marketplace using the Products tab and install relevant products.](./media/1737636787032-2023-10-16_10-10-08-1-gi.gif)\n\n*Browse Marketplace using the Products tab and install relevant products.*\n\n### Clean and simple product discovery\n\nThe Marketplace storefront facilitates easy discovery of products available for installation. All new Marketplace users have two stores available by default:\n\n* The **Foundry Store**, providing Palantir-built products. For example, the [Mapbox boundary datasets](..[/geospatial/ontology.md#using-mapbox-boundaries](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/geospatial/ontology/index.html#using-mapbox-boundaries)).\n* **Reference Resources** used for training purposes. For example, the [Workshop Design Hub]([../workshop/example-applications.md#workshop-design-hub](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/workshop/example-applications/index.html#workshop-design-hub)).\n\nYou may already have other stores available on your Foundry instance if your organization was an early Marketplace adopter.\n\n[Learn more about browsing products]([../marketplace/browse-products.md](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/browse-products/index.html)).\n\n![Browse Foundry products from Palantir and from others within your own organization](./media/1737636791267-screenshot-2023-10-16-at-10-11-48-pn.png)\n\n*Browse Foundry products from Palantir and from others within your own organization*\n\n### Bespoke product installations powered by your preferences\n\nInstallation is simple. Benefit from Marketplace's guided installation workflow - choose the desired installation location and [map your inputs]([../marketplace/install-product.md#inputs](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/install-product/index.html#inputs)) with the intuitive interface.

This allows you to create bespoke product installations powered by your organization's data and preferences. \n\nSimply follow along to complete your installation and start using your new Foundry resources right away.\n\n[Learn more about installing products][(../marketplace/install-product.md)](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/install-product/index.html).\n\n\n![Intuitive product installation process guided by your preferences]()\n\n*Intuitive product installation process guided by your preferences*\n\n### Automatic product upgrades with granular control\n\nUse automatic upgrades, maintenance windows, and release channels to keep your product installation up to date with the latest content from the product owner. \n\n* Maintenance windows: Accept upgrades only when it is convenient for you and your users. For example, you may choose to keep operations flowing by only upgrading during out-of-business hours.\n\n* Release channels: You can choose a unique release channel for each installation. For example, you may want to create multiple installations of the same product with department-specific data, or, configure a release management workflow where each installation tracks a different release channel.\n\n[[Learn more about upgrades](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/installations/index.html#upgrades)](..[/marketplace/installations.md#upgrades](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/installations/index.html#upgrades)).\n\n![Controlled product upgrades](./media/1737636799627-screenshot-2023-10-16-at-10-17-50-pn.png)\n\n*Controlled product upgrades*\n\n### Case study: Marketplace for a customer ecosystem\n\nWe are proud to note that Foundry Marketplace has already enabled one customer to build an ecosystem that allows their clients to have both the ability to collaborate but also to host their own content simultaneously. Marketplace safely separates development and production product versions across multiple applications and user groups, while empowering the customer to iterate on Foundry products and automatically release versions to production as they become ready. As product and user needs naturally evolve, Marketplace's ability to provide granular customization ensures each product installation perfectly suits the needs of each ecosystem participant. \n\n### What's on the development roadmap?\n\nThe release of [Foundry DevOps]([../foundry-devops/overview.md](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/foundry-devops/overview/index.html)), our toolset to create and manage products for installation via Marketplace, is slated to move from limited beta to general availability in early 2024. Contact us at [foundry-support@palantir.com](mailto:foundry-support@palantir.com) if you have a use case that could benefit from early access or to learn more.\n\nLater in 2024, we will make it possible to publish into a central Marketplace store so you can make your products available for other Foundry users to purchase (where relevant) and install.\n\nLearn more about [Foundry Marketplace](../[marketplace/overview.md](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/overview/index.html)) in the documentation.\n\n![ Draft Foghorn Here Docs Team Only ]()\n\n## Draft Foghorn Here [Docs Team Only] \n\n\u003e _Only required for_ ***application***_-level announcements (check \"type\" field in metadata)._\n\n_Foundry_ [product lifecycle](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/development-life-cycle/) _announcement*_\n\n### Title: Marketplace GA: Discover and install Foundry products\n\n[Foundry Marketplace](../[marketplace/overview.md](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/overview/index.html)) enables both technical and non-technical builders to access pre-built solutions for your organization's hardest problems.

Users can now ask the AIP Assist sidebar questions in natural language and receive real-time help with their queries.\n\nBenefits of using AIP Assist include:\n\n* **User-friendly interface:**Â Powered by LLMs, AIP Assist has an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to ask questions and receive relevant, natural, and easy-to-understand responses.\n* **Real-time assistance:**Â AIP Assist provides real-time assistance to empower users to resolve issues and queries quickly, improving user productivity while reducing dependency on support teams.\n* **Multi-language support:**Â AIP can respond to queries in all common languages.\n* **Context awareness:**Â Designed to maintain context of the conversation, AIP Assist is aware of what Foundry application you are in.\n* **Foundry-grade security:**Â AIP Assist respects PalantirâsÂ [AI Ethics Principles](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/palantir-ai-ethics/)Â fully and does not access your data.\n* **Iterative improvements:**Â Users can provide feedback on the quality of AIP Assist responses to help improve the tool as development continues.\n\n## When should I use the AIP Assist sidebar?\n\nThe AIP Assist sidebar leverages context surrounding your request to provide real-time assistance without accessing any of your Organization's data. AIP Assist is trained on Palantir's documentation and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and third-party Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse the user's query and provide the most relevant response, consistent with Palantir's security standards.\n\nExamples of how you may interact with the sidebar could be querying it about the Foundry platform, debugging model integration, or even how to convert a data structure using a Slate function written in JavaScript. These are just a few of the multi-faceted support coverage offered by the AIP Assist sidebar.\n\n![To access this tool on an AIP-enabled instance, select AIP Assist from the workspace navigation bar or access it by a keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+U` on MacOS or `Ctrl+Shift+U` on Windows. Once opened, you can start typing queries in plain text in theÂ Ask a question...Â input field.](./media/1729782774992-image-pn.png)\n\nTo access this tool on an AIP-enabled instance, select AIP Assist from the workspace navigation bar or access it by a keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+U` on MacOS or `Ctrl+Shift+U` on Windows.
